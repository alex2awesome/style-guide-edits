Incorrect usage occurs when these words are swapped or misused in sentences.\n\nHere are 10 example sentences that violate this rule, using \"affect\" and \"effect\" incorrectly:\n\n```python\n[\n    \"The new policy had a significant affect on the community's health.\",\n    \"His speech did not have the desired affect we hoped for.\",\n    \"The medication should effect positive changes in the patient's condition.\",\n    \"She was deeply effected by the news of the tragedy.\",\n    \"The company's decision to relocate will likely effect most employees negatively.\",\n    \"The affect of global warming on weather patterns cannot be ignored.\",\n    \"The new manager hopes to effect a more casual dress code.\",\n    \"The affect of the tax changes on small businesses has been profound.\",\n    \"He tried to effect a British accent during the play, which sounded unnatural.\",\n    \"The economic downturn has effected investment strategies across the board.\"\n]\n```\n\nEach sentence incorrectly uses \"affect\" where \"effect\" should be used, or vice versa, violating the usage rules specified in the style guide.", "key": "/book/ed17/part2/ch05/psec250.html"}

This rule can be broken by:\n   - Not using commas where needed for parenthetical elements.\n   - Using commas in a way that creates confusion or disrupts the flow of the sentence.\n   - Placing parenthetical elements between an adjective and the noun it modifies, which can be awkward.\n\nHere are 10 example sentences that violate this rule, written in the context of news-article sentences:\n\n```python\n[\n    \"The Prime Minister, despite the economic downturn has announced a new stimulus package.\",\n    \"Our local team, although winning the championship last year seems weaker this season.\",\n    \"The new policy aimed at reducing carbon emissions, according to experts will not be sufficient.\",\n    \"The movie star known for her charitable work, surprisingly did not attend the fundraiser.\",\n    \"The technology giant, despite facing several lawsuits continues to dominate the market.\",\n    \"The author's new book, which explores themes of identity and belonging is expected to be a bestseller.\",\n    \"The government's response to the crisis which many criticized, has been revised recently.\",\n    \"The endangered species, due to habitat loss and poaching is at risk of extinction.\",\n    \"The CEO of the company, under investigation by federal authorities has resigned.\",\n    \"The historic building, damaged in the earthquake last year is still awaiting repairs.\"\n]\n```\n\nThese sentences either lack necessary commas around the parenthetical elements, place these elements awkwardly, or disrupt the natural flow of the sentence, thus violating the rule.", "key": "/book/ed17/part2/ch06/psec048.html"}

Violations can occur by not using spaces where needed (e.g., between words or after punctuation), using too many spaces, or using the wrong type of space (like a nonbreaking space where a regular space is needed).\n\nHere are 10 example sentences that violate these spacing rules, styled as news-article sentences:\n\n```python\n[\n    \"In a surprising turn of events,the president announced a new policy initiative today.\",\n    \"Experts argue that climate change could lead to more severe weatherpatterns in the coming years.\",\n    \"The stock market saw a significant drop yesterday,with major indices falling by over 2%.\",\n    \"A recent study shows that young people are less likely to vote than older generations,highlighting a significant gap.\",\n    \"New technology promises to revolutionize the way we use energy,but questions remain about its viability.\",\n    \"Health officials warn of a possible flu epidemic this winter,urging people to get vaccinated soon.\",\n    \"In local news,a new park has opened downtown offering residents a much-needed green space.\",\n    \"The education department released its annual report yesterday,indicating improvements in test scores across the country.\",\n    \"A groundbreaking ceremony took place this morning for the new highway project,expected to ease traffic congestion.\",\n    \"Celebrity chef opens a new restaurant in the city center,bringing unique flavors and dishes to the area.\"\n]\n```\n\nThese sentences include errors such as missing spaces after commas, periods, and before parentheses, which violate the spacing rules outlined in the style guide entry.", "key": "/book/ed17/part2/ch06/psec119.html"}
