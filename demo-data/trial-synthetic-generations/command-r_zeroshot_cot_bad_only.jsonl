The guide suggests that shorter adjectives (one or two syllables) typically use the '-er' suffix, while longer adjectives (three or more syllables) are modified by words like 'more', 'greater', etc. However, there are many exceptions to this.\n \n Here are ten example sentences that violate these comparative adjective rules:\n\n 1. The new smartphone offers a more sleek design than its predecessor, captivating consumers with its slender aesthetic.\n\n2. The sleeker iPhone continues to triumph in the tech space, boasting an elegant and slim design that captivates its users.\n\n3. Official documents leaked, revealing the city's plan for a larger new arena than the one controversially approved by voters.\n\n4. The arena plans have sparked outrage, with residents demanding to know why the proposed design is so excessive in size.\n\n5. The local bakery has a fresh batch of cookies that are simply delightful—a chewier, heartier treat than their usual offerings.\n\n6. Sales of the latest novel from local author Alice Smith are booming, with readers finding the story's gripping plot twists more enthralling than her previous works.\n\n7. Experts are concerned about the rising number of aggressive wild bears in the area, urging campers to be cautious and take necessary precautions—this week's incidents were particularly hostile.\n\n8. The host of the Olympic Games opening ceremony wowed audiences with a dazzling and ambitious performance, a real spectacle that was a glorious preview of the competition to come.\n\n9. The new coffee shop on the corner boasts a cosier ambiance than the chain cafe down the street, attracting a loyal following.\n\n10. Voters in District 5 will head to the polls next week, faced with a pivotal decision between two candidates—the incumbent mayor's record of achievement is impressive, but his rival's campaign has gained momentum with promises of even greater change.\n\n These examples showcase how comparative adjectives are often used in newsy contexts and can be flexible in sentence structure, despite the style guide's guidelines.<|END_OF_TURN_TOKEN|>", "key": "/book/ed17/part2/ch05/psec085.html"}

Yes, this rule can be violated, as language often evolves and changes, and speakers may break these rules for creative or casual purposes.\n\n3.

'Adverse' describes things, 'averse' describes people. e.g. The adverse weather conditions didn't deter the hikers, but some were averse to the idea of climbing the mountain in the snow.\n\n- 'Afflict' and 'inflict' are also often confused. 'Afflict' is suffering that's undergone, whereas 'inflict' is harm that's caused. e.g. The floods afflicted the town, and the government failed to provide any aid, inflicting further distress on the residents.\n\n- 'All together' and 'altogether' have distinct meanings. Don't confuse them! e.g. The band members arrived at the studio all together, but the session was altogether unproductive.\n\n- 'Amount' is used with mass nouns, and 'number' with count nouns. e.g. The amount of rain in the flooded river has decreased, but the number of homes under evacuation orders remains the same.\n\n- 'Any one' is a specific reference to a singular item from a group, while 'anyone' is indeterminate. e.g. The witness claimed to see any one of the three suspects at the scene of the crime, but anyone could have had a motive.\n\n- Avoid 'anyplace', use 'anywhere' for indefinite locations. e.g. The lost phone could be anywhere, and the finders are refusing to return it until the owner pays a large reward.\n\n- Don't use 'as far as' in place of 'as for'. e.g. As for the election, the polls show a tight race, but as far as the candidates' speeches go, there's little substance.\n\n- Distinguish 'apt' and 'likely'. 'Apt' is for general tendencies and 'likely' for probability. e.g. She's apt to be late, and it's likely the restaurant will be crowded when we arrive.\n\nHere are some further examples:\n\n1. The 'access' violation:\n- The journalist accessed the leaked documents, but the story behind them remains a mystery.\n\n2. The 'adverse'/ 'averse' violation:\n- Adverse political winds blew the prime minister off course, and public opinion became increasingly averse to their leadership.\n\n3. The 'afflict'/ 'inflict' violation:\n- The pandemic afflicted the small business community, and the government inflicted further pain by shutting down non-essential services.\n\n4. The 'all together'/ 'altogether' violation:\n- The wedding party arrived all together in limos, but the ceremony was altogether called off due to a dramatic change of heart from the bride.\n\n5. The 'amount'/ 'number' violation:\n- The number of wildfires raging across the state is decreasing, but the amount of damage they've caused is incalculable.\n\n6. The 'any one'/ 'anyone' violation:\n- Anyone could solve the crime, but police have zeroed in on any one suspect, based on flimsy evidence.\n\n7. The 'anyplace'/ 'anywhere' violation:\n- The missing backpack could be anyplace, hidden anywhere in the city, and the search is on to find it before time runs out.\n\n8. The 'as far as'/ 'as for' violation:\n- As for the peace talks, the delegates made little progress, but no one expected any different, as far as these negotiations go.\n\n9. The 'apt'/ 'likely' violation:\n- It's apt that the hurricane hit the coast, and it's likely going to get worse before it gets better.\n\n10.

For example, a recent novel opens with the line: \"Hola, me llamo Isabel y este es mi primer día en el colegio\".\n\n4. Using glosses can be tricky; some scholars prefer to see them marked with single quotes, e.g., 'cortés' for courteous, but this is not universal. \n\n5. The local soccer stadium buzzed with excitement as the commentator exclaimed, «¡Gol de Suárez! —¿Quién sino?—. Un disparo impresionante». \n\n6.

{"message": "1. Yes, a rule is being expressed regarding the placement and format of parenthetical source citations following a block quotation.\n\n2. Yes, this rule can be violated in many ways. \n\n3. The style guide simplifies a complex APA or Chicago-style citation rule: when block quoting, the source appears in parentheses at the end of the quote, with no period after the closing parenthesis.\n\n\nHere are ten example sentences that violate this rule:\n\n1. After an exhaustive search, the missing link to the mayor's scandal was finally revealed. (p. 149) shows that the writer is unaware of the specific rule about omitting the period.\n\n2. The recently discovered diary entry sheds new light on the historical figure's actions during the war; it reads, \"He knew the enemy's plans, yet did nothing to stop the impending attack\" (128). A period after the citation breaks the rule.\n\n3. Could the mysterious disappearances in the triangle be connected to the ancient legend of Atlantis? One brave explorer's account claims, \"There's something out there, waiting just beneath the surface\" (Smith 141).\n\n4. The journalist's exclusive interview with the reclusive author reveals a fascinating detail about his writing process: \"He crafts each sentence with meticulous care, often spending hours on a single paragraph\" (Jones, 43). A full name and page number breaks the rule's brevity.\n\n5. Following the earthquake, survivors shared their tales of survival; one witness recalled, \"The ground shook violently, and then, in an instant, homes were reduced to rubble\" (San Francisco Chronicle, 2023, p. 3). Here, the newspaper name and date should be shortened per the rule.\n\n6. The historical society's latest discovery uncovers a fascinating connection: a previously unknown correspondence between the two authors. The newly discovered letter reads, \"Dear F. Scott, I believe our paths were meant to cross\" (Fitzgerald to Hemingway, 1925, 22). The names and date should follow the simplified style.\n\n7. In an ironic twist, the fashion icon's latest trendsetting look resembles, according to one critic, \"a cross between a clown and a rainbow\" (Vogue, Spring Edition, 77).\n\n8. The block quotation rule is violated comically in this news blurb: \"A husky voice echoes through the valley, 'What's that old saying—Location, location, location?' A lost hiker, with a flair for the dramatic, was found safe near a remote cabin after a three-day search (ABC News, 8pm broadcast).\n\n9. Time seems to have been turned askew in the small town of Millfield; residents report \"a strange phenomenon, where past, present, and future blend\" (The Millfield Mirror, 2024, p. 6). A local newspaper title would not be capitalized per the rule.\n\n10. Space exploration takes a thrilling turn as NASA discovers an asteroid headed towards Earth. One scientist's notes reveal a chilling detail: \"Our calculations show it's on a direct collision course\" (Dr. Jenkins' private journal, entry 342, p. 11).

{"message": "1. Yes, a specific rule regarding parenthetical citations following poetry extracts is being expressed.\n\n2. Yes, this rule can be violated – there are several options mentioned for positioning citations, and any of these styles can be inconsistent with each other.\n\n3. When citing poetry, keep the formatting consistent and clear – but there are a few ways to do this.\n\n\nHere are ten example sentences that violate the rule, each in a news-style:\n\n1. Following the poem's publication, scholars debated the location of the citation, some preferring the citation placed at the center, others arguing for it to be justified left, in the style of a standard news article.\n\n2. The editor, in a controversial move, chose to place the citation in the middle of the page, disrupting the poetic flow and angering many readers.\n\n3. The whirling words and mysterious metaphors of the extract were brought to life by an innovative production design team, with a simple trick: the citation was projected onto the stage, floating above the performers.\n\n4. Some readers might find the notes distracting, as they appear mid-poem, jarring the reader from the flow of the narrative.\n\n5. There's no doubt the citation belongs at the margin, given the poem's delicate subject matter — an issue that the author, in their wisdom, likely anticipated.\n\n6. For readers who hunger for clarity, the editor offers an unusual solution: a double-columned presentation, with the citation gracefully flowing into a brief author biography.\n\n7. The citation's placement is a conundrum: centered, it seems to interrupt the nightingale's song; left-aligned, it seems to quiet the bird's melody.\n\n8. In a bold move, a new edition places the citations as footnotes, with intricate references woven into the poem's fabric.\n\n9. The world's most famous poet, known for their enigmatic style, once again confounds readers with an extract that ends abruptly, the citation seemingly lost in the starlight.\n\n10. Only upon finishing the final stanza do readers encounter the citation, neatly tucked away, revealing the poem's true meaning with a mysterious postscript.\n\nThese examples certainly break the rule of consistent, clear formatting, each presenting a unique take on the challenge of citing poetry extracts.<|END_OF_TURN_TOKEN|>", "key": "/book/ed17/part2/ch13/psec071.html"}
