{"message": "There is a rule being expressed in this entry, and it can be violated. The rule is that when an abbreviation follows an indefinite article, the choice of \"a\" or \"an\" is determined by the way the abbreviation would be read aloud. Acronyms are read as words and are rarely preceded by \"a,\" \"an,\" or \"the,\" except when used adjectivally. Initialisms, which are read as a series of letters, are often preceded by a definite article, but this may depend on established usage.\n\nHere are 10 example sentences that violate this rule, presented as a Python list:\n\n```\n[\n    \"A WHO report warned of an increasing number of UFO sightings.\",\n    \"The UN has a new initiative to combat climate change.\",\n    \"The FBI arrested a suspect in the AA meeting shooting.\",\n    \"The US is considering a NAACP proposal for police reform.\",\n    \"The UK is facing an HIV crisis among MS patients.\",\n    \"The NYT published an article about an MS by a famous author.\",\n    \"The NBA announced a new partnership with an AI company.\",\n    \"The EU is imposing sanctions on an HMO for price gouging.\",\n    \"The BBC interviewed a DIY expert for a home improvement segment.\",\n    \"The WHO issued a warning about an E coli outbreak in the US.\"\n]\n```\n\nIn each of these sentences, the indefinite article \"a\" or \"an\" is used before an abbreviation based on how the abbreviation is commonly spoken, rather than how it would be read aloud. For example, \"an UFO\" is used instead of \"a UFO\" because \"UFO\" is often pronounced as a single syllable starting with a vowel sound. However, according to the rule, \"a UFO\" would be correct because \"UFO\" is an acronym that is read as a word. Similarly, \"an AI company\" is used instead of \"a AI company\" because \"AI\" is often pronounced as a single syllable starting with a vowel sound. However, according to the rule, \"a AI company\" would be correct because \"AI\" is an initialism that is read as a series of letters.</s>", "key": "/book/ed17/part2/ch10/psec009.html"}
