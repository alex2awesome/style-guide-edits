0,a or an before H?,"Use an before a silent H: an heir, an hour, an honest politician, an honorary consul; use a before an aspirated H: a hero, a hotel, a historian (but don’t change a direct quote if the speaker says, for example, “an historic”). With abbreviations, be guided by pronunciation: eg an LSE student"
1,A*,(A-level and GCSE) not A-star

4,"Abbas, Mahmoud",president of the Palestinian Authority
5,abbeys,"take initial cap, eg Westminster Abbey"
6,Abbottabad,city in Pakistan where Osama bin Laden lived and died
7,abbreviations and acronyms,"Do not use full points in abbreviations, or spaces between initials, including those in proper names: IMF, mph, eg, 4am, M&S, No 10, AN Wilson, WH Smith, etc.

Use all capitals if an abbreviation is pronounced as the individual letters (an initialism): BBC, CEO, US, VAT, etc; if it is an acronym (pronounced as a word) spell out with initial capital, eg Nasa, Nato, Unicef, unless it can be considered to have entered the language as an everyday word, such as awol, laser and, more recently, asbo, pin number and sim card. Note that pdf and plc are lowercase.

If an abbreviation or acronym is to be used more than once in a piece, put it in brackets at first mention: so Association of Chief Police Officers (Acpo), seasonal affective disorder (Sad); alternatively, use the abbreviation with a brief description, eg the conservation charity the RSPB. Remember that our international online readership will not necessarily be aware of even well-known UK abbreviations. If an organisation is mentioned only once, it is not necessary to give its abbreviation or acronym.

Cap up single letters in such expressions as C-list, F-word, “the word assassin contains four Ss”, etc"
8,"Abd el-Fattah, Alaa",British-Egyptian democracy activist jailed in Egypt
9,abdicate,"renounce high office abnegate renounce privileges, deny oneself abrogate repeal, abolish arrogate take or claim (something) for oneself without justification"
10,abjure,renounce adjure urge
11,Aboriginal Australians,"should be identified by their country or language groups at first mention if known, eg a Wiradjuri-Yorta Yorta man, a Noongar-Badimaya woman – or take your cue from how they identify themselves. The term “Aborigine” is outdated and offensive; Aboriginal should only be used as an adjective. Indigenous Australians is an umbrella term that covers both Aboriginal people from the Australian mainland and Torres Strait Islanders"
12,abortion,"Use pro-choice , not pro-abortion; and use anti-abortion , not pro-life. Anti-choice can be used when talking about opposition to all reproductive rights, including abortion, birth control, family planning etc.

In reference to US legislation, six-week abortion ban is preferable to foetal heartbeat bill, unless quoting someone talking about the “heartbeat bill”"

22,accents,"Use on French, German, Portuguese, Spanish and Irish Gaelic words (but not anglicised French words such as cafe, apart from exposé, lamé, résumé, roué). People’s names, in whatever language, should also be given appropriate accents where known. Thus: “Arsène Wenger was on holiday in Bogotá with Rafa Benítez”"

24,access,has been known as contact since the 1989 Children Act

33,act,"uppercase when using the full name, eg Criminal Justice Act 1998, Official Secrets Act; but lowercase on second reference, eg “the act”, and when speaking in more general terms, eg “we need a radical freedom of information act”; bills remain lowercase until passed into law"
34,Action on Hearing Loss,formerly known as the Royal National Institute for Deaf People (RNID)
35,actor,"Use for both male and female actors; do not use actress except when in the name of an award, eg Oscar for best actress. The Guardian’s view is that actress comes into the same category as authoress, comedienne, manageress, “lady doctor”, “male nurse” and similar obsolete terms that date from a time when professions were largely the preserve of one sex (usually men). As Whoopi Goldberg put it in an interview with the paper: “An actress can only play a woman. I’m an actor – I can play anything.”

There is normally no need to differentiate between the sexes – and if there is, the words male and female are perfectly adequate: Lady Gaga won a Brit in 2010 for best international female artist, not artiste, chanteuse, or songstress.

As always, use common sense: a piece about the late film director Carlo Ponti was edited to say that in his early career he was “already a man with a good eye for pretty actors ...” As the readers’ editor pointed out in the subsequent clarification: “This was one of those occasions when the word ‘actresses’ might have been used”"
36,"AD, BC","AD goes before the date (AD64), BC goes after (300BC); both go after the century, eg second century AD, fourth century BC"
37,adaptation,not adaption
38,adapter,someone who adapts; adaptor plug
39,"adblocker, adblocking",
40,addendum,"plural addendums

Latinate -um neuter endings that are a part of the language (eg stadium) take an -s plural. Exceptions: bacteria, which retain the Latin plural and take a plural verb, as do media, but note that spiritualists are mediums"
41,addresses,"like this: 90 York Way, London N1 9GU"
42,Adidas,"initial cap, although adidas is lc in the company logo"
43,administration,"the Obama administration, etc"
44,"admissible, inadmissible",not -able
45,admit,"Take care – as a reader put it when we referred to Tory MPs who “admitted” being gay: “Admit in modern English is almost exclusively used when conceding or confessing something negative and/or of which one is or should be ashamed. Please be more careful. Language can offend.” Quite.

The former Washington Post editor Ben Bradlee urged reporters not to “hide their biases and emotions behind subtly pejorative words” such as admit"
46,ad nauseam,not ad nauseum
47,adoption,"Mention that children are adopted only when relevant to the story: a reader points out that “explicitly calling attention to adoptions in this way suggests that adoption is not as good, and not as real a relationship, as having a child normally”. So say biological father, biological family rather than “real father”, “real family”, etc"
48,Adrenalin,TM; a brand of adrenaline
49,adrenaline,"hormone that increases heart rate and blood pressure, extracted from animals or synthesised for medical uses"

The first was pioneered by Fela Kuti in the 1960s and is a mix of west African musical styles, such as fuji music and highlife, with American funk and jazz; the second is an umbrella term for 21st-century west African pop music, combining Ghanaian and Nigerian pop music with western rap influences."

a 62-year-old man; a 62-year-old; 62 years old.

the woman was in her 20s (but twentysomething, thirtysomething, etc)

Be clear when referring to age groups, such as the over-80s or under-16s, as sometimes these groupings don’t include the people who are actually 80 or 16; if the group does include them, a formulation such as 80 or over, or 16 and above can be clearer for readers. In headlines it is OK to use the shorter description when necessary"
74,agenda,"plural in origin, but singular in use: “agendum” is simply not on anyone’s agenda"
75,Age UK,charity formed by the merger of Age Concern and Help the Aged in 2009
76,aggravate,"Using this word to mean annoy, rather than make worse, really aggravates some people. Good. Both meanings have been around for more than 400 years, and there is no good reason why both should not be acceptable now .

.

She only wanted to threaten him and aggravate him ... Wilkie Collins, The Woman in White (1860)

She only wanted to threaten him and aggravate him ..."

82,aide-de-camp,plural aides-de-camp (aide is a noun)
83,aide-memoire,plural aide-memoires (aide is a verb)
84,Aids,"acquired immune deficiency syndrome, but normally no need to spell out.

Do not use such terms as “Aids victims” or someone “suffering from Aids”, language that in the words of one reader is “crass, inaccurate and reinforces stigma”, implying helplessness and inviting pity; “people with Aids” or “living with Aids” are preferable.

Do not use the term “full-blown Aids”. Unesco guidelines state: “This term implies that there are varying stages of Aids ... People have Aids only when they present with an Aids-defining illness”"

92,air vice-marshal,
93,AKA,also known as
94,akimbo,See arms akimbo
95,al-,"Means “the”. In names it is not capitalised, eg Ahmad al-Saqqaf, and can be dropped after the first mention (Mr Saqqaf). For placenames we drop it altogether. Sometimes it appears as as- or ash- or ad- or ul-: these should be ignored and can be safely rewritten as al-. But some Arabs, including Syrians and Egyptians, prefer to use el- in place of al-. Exceptions: by convention, Allah (al-Lah, literally “the God”) is written as one word and capitalised; and in Saudi royal names, Al Saud is correct (in this case, “al” is actually “aal” and does not mean “the”)."
96,al-Aqsa Martyrs Brigade,
97,al-Aqsa mosque,"not the Aqsa mosque, or the al-Aqsa mosque. Not to be confused in pictures with the nearby Dome of the Rock. The mosque’s dome is silver-grey, whereas the Dome of the Rock, an Islamic shrine, has a large golden dome.

112,Alice books,"Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland, by Lewis Carroll (Charles Lutwidge Dodgson), was published in 1865; its sequel, which followed six years later, is called Through the Looking-Glass, and What Alice Found There. Note that they are not called “Alice in Wonderland” and “Alice Through the Looking-Glass”"
113,A-list,"etc, but to refer to “C-list celebrities” and its variations has become tedious. An edition of G2 referred to “D-list celebrities” and, less than hilariously, in a separate piece about the same reality TV show, “Z-list celebrities”"
114,Al Jazeera,
115,alkyl nitrite,not nitrate; commonly known as poppers
116,Allah,Arabic for “the God”. Both words refer to the same concept: there is no major difference between God in the Old Testament and Allah in Islam. Therefore it makes sense to talk about “God” in an Islamic context and to use “Allah” in quotations or for literary effect
117,Allahu Akbar,“God is greatest”
118,"Allawi, Ayad",Iraqi politician
119,"Allende, Isabel",Chilean author; her father was a cousin of Salvador Allende

121,allies,"second world war allies, the allied invasion, etc"
122,all mouth and trousers,not “all mouth and no trousers”
123,all right,"has traditionally been regarded as right, and alright as not all right (although the 1965 Who song, much loved by generations of headline writers and still widely quoted today, was The Kids are Alright).

Kingsley Amis in The King’s English said alright was “gross, crass, coarse and to be avoided” but admitted this was “a rule without a reason”.

Note, however, the difference between “she got the answers all right” and “she got the answers, alright!”"
124,All Souls College,"Oxford, no apostrophe"
125,all together,as one united body: “We are all in it together”
126,altogether,"completely, totally: “That’s an altogether different matter”"

138,also,often redundant
139,alter ego,"not “altar ego”, as we have been known to spell it"

145,Amazon Prime,
146,Amazon Prime Video,"for the TV package, although these days it prefers to call itself simply Prime Video"
147,ambassador,"lc, eg the British ambassador to Washington; “ambassador, you are spoiling us” has become a headline cliche"
148,ambience,not ambiance
149,ambiguity,"a common problem in headlines when the subject is omitted from the past tense of a verb, as in this example from the paper:

Westworld extras allegedly asked to participate in ‘graphic sexual situations’

Did they allegedly ask, or were they allegedly asked? A simple “were” before “asked” would have fixed this. Similarly:

Labour warned of financial crash (did someone warn Labour of an impending crash, or did Labour warn someone else?)

Tories paid millions to avoid tax Here not only does the reader have to ask whether the Tories paid millions or were paid millions, but also whether they paid millions of pounds or millions of people, and whether the Tories’ aim was to avoid tax or to enable the millions to avoid tax. This is very poor editing"
150,ambulance services,"These are NHS trusts, so lc for everything that is generic, eg London ambulance service, East of England ambulance service, South East Coast ambulance service"
151,amendments,"to the US constitution like this: fifth amendment, 18th amendment, etc"

155,American English,"Follow US spellings for proper nouns, eg Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Department of Defense, Labor Day, One World Trade Center, Ann Arbor, Pearl Harbor, World Health Organization"
156,American universities,"Take care: “University of X” is not the same as “X University”; most states have two large public universities, eg University of Kentucky and Kentucky State University, University of Illinois and Illinois State University, etc.

Do not call Johns Hopkins University “John Hopkins” or Stanford University “Stamford”"
157,America’s Cup,"sailing trophy named after the schooner America, its first winner"
158,Amhrán na bhFiann,Irish national anthem
159,Amicus,"trade union formed by a merger between the AEEU and MSF, now part of Unite after a further merger with the TGWU"
160,amid,"not amidst.

“James warned, however, that the second half of the year was likely to prove more challenging overall amid a weak consumer backdrop.”

Things fall against a backdrop, not amid one. If something is amid the backdrop, it’s part of it, and thus completely unremarkable . Some cliches make the news sound tired; this one makes the news sound as if it’s not news at all

against

and thus completely unremarkable"
161,amok,not amuck
162,among,not amongst
163,among or between?,"Whatever you may have been told, between is not limited to two parties. It is appropriate when the relationship is essentially reciprocal: fighting between the many peoples of Yugoslavia, treaties between European countries, etc; among belongs to distributive relationships: shared among, etc"
164,amount or number?,"amount refers to a quantity, number to something that can be counted, eg an enormous amount of energy was exerted by a small number of people"
165,ampersand,"Use in company names when the company does: Johnson & Johnson, Marks & Spencer, P&O, etc, but use “and” in the names of government departments and agencies: Department of Work and Pensions, Advanced Research and Invention Agency etc"
166,anaesthetic,
167,analysis,plural analyses
168,anarchism,"a political philosophy that advocates stateless societies, holding the state to be undesirable, unnecessary and harmful.

The term “anarchist” is bandied about carelessly, often used by politicians and the media to denigrate opponents of the status quo, and should be used with care; “self-styled anarchist” should be avoided altogether"
169,ancestors,precede descendants; we frequently manage to get them the wrong way round
170,and/or,This is horrible. Make your mind up and say either “and” or “or” – whichever is more appropriate. The same applies to the phrase “if and when”

175,Anglesey,"Always also include its Welsh name, Ynys Môn, possibly in brackets at first mention. Anglesey is the name of the island; Isle of Anglesey is the name of its county, which also includes nearby Holy Island, and Ynys Môn is the name of the UK parliament and Senedd constituency that covers the same area. Ynys Môn is the Welsh name for both the island and the county"
176,"anglicise, anglophile, anglophone",

178,annex,verb; annexe noun; I am going to annex the annexe for the afternoon
179,anniversaries,"first anniversary, 10th anniversary etc; not one-year anniversary, 10-year anniversary. There is no such thing as a six-month anniversary"
180,anorexic,"is not a superlative of thin. Anorexia is an illness. Like schizophrenia, it should not be used as a cheap and lazy metaphor. Anyone who thinks of using a phrase such as “positively anorexic” should think again"

200,apex,plural apexes
201,apostrofly,"“an insect that lands at random on the printed page, depositing an apostrophe wherever it lands” according to the Guardian’s former readers’ editor"
202,apostrophes,"used to indicate a missing letter or letters (can’t, we’d) or a possessive (David’s book).

Don’t let anyone tell you that apostrophes don’t matter and we would be better off without them. Consider these four phrases, each of which means something different: my sister’s friend’s books (refers to one sister and her friend). my sister’s friends’ books (one sister with lots of friends). my sisters’ friend’s books (more than one sister, and their friend). my sisters’ friends’ books (more than one sister, and their friends).

The possessive in words and names ending in S normally takes an apostrophe followed by a second S (Jones’s, James’s), but be guided by pronunciation and use the plural apostrophe where it helps: Mephistopheles’, Waters’, Hedges’ rather than Mephistopheles’s, Waters’s, Hedges’s.

Plural nouns that do not end in S take an apostrophe and S in the possessive: children’s games, old folk’s home, people’s republic, etc.

Phrases such as butcher’s knife, collector’s item, cow’s milk, goat’s cheese, pig’s blood, hangman’s noose, writer’s cramp, etc are treated as singular.

Use apostrophes in phrases such as two days’ time, 12 years’ imprisonment and six weeks’ holiday, where the time period (two days) modifies a noun (time), but not in nine months pregnant or three weeks old, where the time period is adverbial (modifying an adjective such as pregnant or old) – if in doubt, test with a singular such as one day’s time, one month pregnant.

Proper names that contain an apostrophe stay the same in the possessive: McDonald’s burgers may be delicious but Sainsbury’s are just as good.

Some shops use an apostrophe, wrongly, to indicate a plural (“pea’s”), but will generally omit the apostrophe when one is actually required (“new seasons asparagus”), a phenomenon sometimes referred to as the greengrocer’s (or grocer’s) apostrophe. Try to avoid this"
203,app,"an application for, typically, a mobile phone"
204,appal,"but as the former Prince of Wales might have said, it really is appalling"
205,apparatchik,
206,appeal,"In British English you appeal against a decision, verdict, etc, you do not “appeal the verdict”. After we reported on 9 June 2010 that a convicted murderer “successfully appealed the sentence”, a despairing reader wrote: “This usage seems to be occurring more and more, sometimes even in headlines. Do Guardian journalists not read the style guide?” Not all of them, evidently"
207,appendix,plural appendices

209,apples,"lc: cox’s orange pippin, golden delicious, granny smith, etc"
210,appraise,to evaluate
211,apprise,to inform
212,April Fools’ Day,"also known, less commonly nowadays, as All Fools’ Day; an individual prank, or the victim of one, is an April fool, so you might say “one of the greatest April fools was the Guardian’s San Serriffe issue of 1977 – it made April fools of all who were taken in”"
213,apropos,"Used most commonly to mean “with regard to”, it does not need a preposition, so “apropos your question ... “ But note the idiomatic “apropos of nothing ...” which means something like “changing the subject” or “incidentally”.

Used to mean “pertinent” or “relevant to”, now rather rare, you might say “the thought was apropos to this” or, even more quaintly, “the point was apropos”.

The French idiom “à propos de bottes” (“with regard to boots”), meaning without rhyme or reason, was used by, among others, George Orwell"
214,aquarium,plural aquariums
215,Arab,"Both a noun and an adjective, and the preferred adjective when referring to Arab things in general, eg Arab history, Arab traditions. Arabic usually refers to the language and literature: “the Arabic press” means newspapers written in Arabic, while “the Arab press” would include newspapers produced by Arabs in other languages.

There is no simple definition of an Arab. At an international level, the 22 members of the Arab League can safely be described as Arab countries: Algeria, Bahrain, Comoros, Djibouti, Egypt, Iraq, Jordan, Kuwait, Lebanon, Libya, Mauritania, Morocco, Oman, Palestine, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Somalia, Sudan, Syria, Tunisia, United Arab Emirates, and Yemen. At a human level, there are substantial groups within those countries – the Berbers of north Africa and the Kurds, for example – who do not regard themselves as Arabs."
216,Arabic names,"Though Arabic has only three vowels – a, i and u – it has several consonants that have no equivalent in the Roman alphabet. For instance, there are two kinds of s, d and t. There are also two glottal sounds. This means there are dozens of ways of writing the former Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi’s name in English, and a reasonable argument can be made for adopting almost any of them. With no standard approach to transliteration agreed by the western media, we must try to balance consistency, comprehensibility and familiarity – which often puts a strain on all three.

Typically, Arabs have at least three names. In some cases the first or second name may be the one that is most used, and this does not imply familiarity (Arabs often address foreigners politely as “Mr John” or “Dr David”). Often Arabs also have familiar names that have no connection with the names on their identity cards: a man might become known after the birth of his first son as “Abu Ahmad”, and a woman as “Umm Ahmad”, the father or mother of Ahmad (eg the Palestinian leader Ahmed Qureia is commonly known as Abu Ala).

Where a particular spelling has become widely accepted through usage we should retain it. Where an individual with links to the west has clearly adopted a particular spelling of his or her own name, we should respect that. For breaking news and stories using names for which we have no established style, we take the lead given by Reuters wire copy.

Note also that names in some parts of the Arab world have become gallicised, while others have become anglicised, eg the leading Egyptian film director Youssef Chahine uses a French spelling instead of the English transliteration, Shaheen.

Some guidelines (for use particularly where there is no established transliteration)

Some guidelines (for use particularly where there is no established transliteration)"
217,"abdul, abu and bin","These are not self-contained names, but are connected to the name that follows: abdul means “slave of … “ and so cannot correctly be used on its own. There are standard combinations, “slave of the merciful one”, “slave of the generous one”, etc, which all indicate that the person is a servant of God. In transliteration, “abd” (slave) is lowercase, eg Ahmad abd al-Rahman al-Saqqaf, except when used at the start of a name; abu (father of) and bin (son of) are similar. When they appear in the middle of a name they should be lower case and are used in combination with the following part of the name: Faisal abu Ahmad al-Saqqaf, Faisal bin Ahmad al-Saqqaf. Despite the above, some people are actually known as “Abdul”. This is more common among non-Arab Muslims. And some Arabs run “abd” or “abu” into the following word, eg the writer Abdelrahman Munif."
218,Muhammad,"Muslims consider Muhammad to be the last of God’s prophets, who delivered God’s final message. They recognise Moses and Jesus as prophets also.

The above transliteration is our style for the prophet’s name and for most Muhammads living in Arab countries, though where someone’s preferred spelling is known we respect it, eg Mohamed Al Fayed, Mohamed ElBaradei."
219,"Muhandis/Mohandes, Qadi","Be wary of names where the first word is Muhandis or Qadi: these are honorary titles, meaning engineer and judge respectively"
220,European surnames of Arabic origin,"The guidelines above do not apply in examples such as the French labour minister, Myriam El Khomri. She is French born and only has one surname, which appears on her birth certificate and passport, written in the Latin alphabet; there is no other spelling. So she should be referred to as Myriam El Khomri at first mention and El Khomri thereafter.

Similarly, the two 2016 Brussels airport suicide bombers, Ibrahim and Khalid El Bakraoui, were Belgian born. The Belgian legal system and prosecutors refer to them by the surname El Bakraoui, and we should too"

222,Aran Island,"is off Co Donegal and the Aran Islands off Co Galway in western Ireland; the Isle of Arran is the largest island in the Firth of Clyde in Scotland. Aran sweaters, whether Irish or Scottish, come with an initial cap A"
223,arcane,esoteric; archaic antiquated
224,archbishops,"It is not normally necessary to use their formal title, which for both Anglicans and Catholics is Most Rev: so Justin Welby, the archbishop of Canterbury, at first mention, thereafter Welby or the archbishop (except in leading articles, where he is Mr Welby); Vincent Nichols, the archbishop of Westminster, on first mention, subsequently Nichols or the archbishop"
225,archdeacon,"the Ven Paul Olive, archdeacon of Farringdon, at first mention; thereafter Olive, or the archdeacon"
226,archery,"arrows are shot, rather than fired; and if they hit the centre of the target, it is a gold rather than a bullseye"
227,archetype or stereotype?,"An archetype is a perfect or typical specimen, an original model or pattern, or prototype.

A stereotype is based on simplistic generalisations about a particular group. So the matriarch in a typical Woody Allen film might be described as a stereotypical, not archetypal, Jewish mother"
228,archipelago,plural archipelagos
229,architect or designer?,"The title of architect is protected under UK law and should only be used to describe someone who is registered as such. If someone works on building design but is not registered as an architect they are most likely to be called a designer, eg Thomas Heatherwick arch-rival an arch rival would mean something different"

237,Armistice Day,but the armistice
238,arms akimbo,"hands on hips, elbows out; it is surprising how often the phrase “legs akimbo” turns up in the paper, “suggesting that such a posture exists, but lacks a word to define it”, as David McKie wrote.

The radical theatre group in the BBC TV comedy series The League of Gentlemen was called Legz Akimbo"

243,arse,British English; ass American English
244,arsing about,rather than arseing
245,art movements,"are generally lowercase, eg art deco, art nouveau, cubism, dadaism, expressionism, gothic, impressionism, pop art, surrealism, etc, but note Bauhaus, Modern (in the sense of Modern British, to distinguish it from “modern art”, pre-Raphaelite, Romantic (to differentiate between a romantic painting and a Romantic painting)"
246,artefact,
247,artificial intelligence,AI on second mention and in headlines. Be careful not to overuse. An AI system is one able to improve from previous experiences or one created through training and learning rather than human coding or simple algorithms

251,as ... as,"“The hawthorn may be as old, if not older, than the stone tower of the windmill,” which appeared in the paper, should have read: “The hawthorn may be as old as, if not older than, the stone tower of the windmill.”

A common error that is quite easy to spot if you try to read it without the phrase inside the commas: as old ... than (wrong); as old ... as (right)"
252,as or since?,"“As” is causal: I cannot check the online style guide as the connection is down; “since” is temporal: Luckily, I have had the latest edition of Guardian Style on my desk since it was published"

259,Asio,"Australian Security and Intelligence Service, the country’s domestic counter-intelligence and security agency (the equivalent of Britain’s MI5)"
260,Asperger syndrome,"but it is acceptable to call it Asperger’s for short. Some people dislike the name because of the association with Hans Asperger, or consider it outdated, so it is better to use the broader term “autistic” unless you know a person prefers to say they have Asperger’s, in which case you should respect that preference. Do not use such witticisms as “Asperger-ish men”, which had to be removed from our website"

269,asylum seeker,"Someone seeking refugee status or humanitarian protection; there is no such thing as an “illegal asylum seeker”, a term the Press Complaints Commission ruled in breach of its code of practice.

Refugees are people who have fled their home countries in fear for their lives, and may have been granted asylum under the 1951 refugee convention or qualify for humanitarian protection or discretionary leave, or have been granted exceptional leave to remain in Britain.

Someone who is refused asylum should be referred to as a refused asylum seeker, not a “failed asylum seeker”.

An asylum seeker can become an illegal immigrant only if he or she remains in Britain after having failed to respond to a removal notice"

285,Australasia,Oceania is preferable. See Oceania
286,Australian Labor party,not Labour
287,autism,"Autism is a neurodevelopmental disorder, not an illness. Use only when referring to the condition, not as a term of abuse or in producing such witticisms as “mindless moral autism” and “Star Wars is a form of male autism”, both of which have appeared in the paper"
288,autistic people,"largely regard autism as a fundamental part of who they are, so dislike being described as having autism, or being people with autism/living with autism. Whenever possible, ask a person how they prefer to be described. (Further reading: National Autistic Society guidance on writing about autism ) autocorrect, autocomplete but auto-predict"

294,avant garde,no hyphen
295,"average, mean and median","Although we loosely refer to the “average” in many contexts (eg pay), there are two useful averages worth distinguishing.

What is commonly known as the average is the mean: everyone’s wages are added up and divided by the number of wage earners. The median is described as “the value below which 50% of employees fall”, ie it is the wage earned by the middle person when everyone’s wages are lined up from smallest to largest. (For even numbers there are two middle people, but you calculate the mean average of their two wages.)

The median is often a more useful guide than the mean, which can be distorted by figures at one extreme or the other"
296,awaken,"Say “I woke up”, “I was woken up” and so on because the forms starting with A are either considered wrong (“I was awoken”) or sound wrong (“I was awakened”). The US grammarian Bryan A Garner says: “The past-tense and past-participial forms of ‘wake’ and its various siblings are perhaps the most vexing in the language.”

Exception: Star Wars: Episode VII – The Force Awakens"
297,awards and prizes,"are generally lc, eg Guardian first book award, Nobel peace prize (but note Academy Awards) lc for categories, eg Colin Firth won the best actor Oscar, Chipmunk was voted best newcomer at the 2008 Mobos, etc"

314,Baby P,"Peter Connelly, who died in Haringey in 2007, was known as Baby P or Baby Peter"
315,"babysit, babysitter","the noun “baby-sitter” came first (in 1937), and the verb “to baby-sit” was derived from it a decade later, an interesting example of back-formation"
316,baccalaureate,"abbreviation bac, but the new English baccalaureate is abbreviated to Ebacc"
317,bacchanalia,"originally wild festivals dedicated to the god Bacchus; now drunken revelry as found in most British towns on a Saturday night, lowercase with singular verb: the bacchanalia is likely to continue until we all pass out"
318,"Bacharach, Burt","US songwriter, born 1928"

343,Balochistan,"not Baluchistan or Baluchestan for the largest province of Pakistan. Baloch is the adjective for general use, but also refers to a specific ethnic group, so be wary of applying it to people; Balochi is a language"
344,BAME,"black, Asian and minority ethnic; spelled out in full at first mention, but where possible it is always preferable to be more specific and to avoid using BAME in furniture. Other alternatives are person/people of colour, or minority ethnic people. However, when using an alternative always check that it doesn’t change the accuracy of the story, eg the term minority ethnic in its broadest sense includes white people, such as Travellers and Gypsies, so if a story citing BAME research is actually only about people of colour, use of the term minority ethnic would be incorrect. Likewise, avoid using people of colour when the BAME research in question may include minority ethnic white people. (See also black .)"

Bands that do not take the definite article (although they are often erroneously given it) include Arctic Monkeys, Pet Shop Boys and Ramones; for most bands, this can be easily checked online.

Bands take a plural verb: Snow Patrol are overrated, Iron Butterfly were the loudest band of the 60s, etc.

Try to include diacritical marks if bands use them in their name, no matter how absurd: Maxïmo Park, Mötley Crüe, Motörhead, etc; for a comprehensive list see the excellent “ metal umlaut” entry on Wikipedia"

391,bearing children,"Such phrases as “she bore him two sons” and “he had two children by” are outdated and sexist. We said of Wendi Deng that she “went on to bear [Rupert Murdoch] two children”. As a reader complained: “Surely an expression which implies that a woman has a child for a man has no place in the Guardian ... How about ‘they had two children’?”

We also said that the late David Frost had “three sons by Carina Fitzalan-Howard” and referred to Mick Jagger’s “two sons by Jerry Hall”, as if the mothers were racehorses. Men have children with, not by, women"

406,begs the question,"This phrase is almost invariably misused: it means assuming a proposition that, in reality, involves the conclusion. An example would be to say that parallel lines will never meet, because they are parallel.

The concept can be traced as far back as Aristotle, but HW Fowler, whose entry on begging the question is listed under the Latin petitio principii (assumption of the basis), defines it as “the fallacy of founding a conclusion on a basis that as much needs to be proved as the conclusion itself”, giving as an example “foxhunting is not cruel, since the fox enjoys the fun”.

Now used widely to mean “raises the question”, its traditional sense is being lost, which seems a sad fate for a phrase that might be useful or even – in a logical or philosophical context – essential"

435,bete noire,no accents
436,betting odds,"We frequently get this wrong. A brief explanation: long odds (eg 100-1 against, normally expressed as 100-1) mean something unlikely; shorter odds (eg 10-1) still mean it’s unlikely, but less unlikely; odds on (eg 2-1 on, sometimes expressed as 1-2) means it is likely, so if you were betting £2 you would win only £1 plus the stake.

Take care using the phrase “odds on”: if Labour is quoted by bookmakers at 3-1 to win a byelection, and the odds are cut to 2-1, it is wrong to say “the odds on Labour to win were cut last night” – in fact, the odds against Labour to win have been cut (the shorter the price, the more likely something is expected to happen).

It gets more complicated when something is genuinely odds-on, ie bookmakers quote a price of “2-1 on”: in this case, if the Labour candidate is quoted at 2-1 on and becomes an even hotter favourite, at 3-1 on, the odds have shortened; if Labour loses popularity, and 2-1 on becomes, say, 7-4 on or evens, the odds have lengthened"
437,between 15 and 20,not “between 15 to 20” or “between 15-20”

441,Beyoncé,
442,beyond the pale,"not pail; this pale is derived from the Latin palus, a stake as used to support a fence (cf palisade); hence the figurative meaning of beyond the pale as being outside the boundary, unacceptable"
443,biannual or biennial?,"As no one can agree which of these means twice a year, and which means every two years, it’s best not to use them at all; “twice a year” or “every two years” are unambiguous.

The same applies to bimonthly and biweekly: say “every fortnight”, “twice a month” or “every two months”, and so on. It’s remarkable that no one has sorted this problem out; nearly a century ago, HW Fowler was already calling it “a cause of endless confusion”"

Howbeit the great multitude of believers knoweth this translation not.

Wherefore let them be quoted in such manner that the people may understand”"

475,bitterest,"use of this word by the Guardian in 2006 provoked a bitter controversy among readers, many of whom (rightly) pointed out that there is nothing wrong with it"
476,black,"should be used only as an adjective when referring to race, ie not “blacks” but “black people” or whatever noun is appropriate. There is debate about the capitalisation of black, with some using it as a physical descriptor, others to describe a specific cultural group, therefore while generally lower case, if a subject, writer or editor of a story prefers to use Black then that choice should be respected.

481,Black Country,
482,the Black Forest,"for the place, but black forest gateau"
483,black holes,"referring to a fiscal “black hole” gives the impression there is an inexorable compulsion to fill the gap. As governments are able to run a deficit if they choose, this can be misleading. There are other, less politically loaded alternatives, such as “shortfall” or even, simply, “hole”"
484,black market or black economy,hidden or parallel economy are preferable

499,Bloody Sunday,"Take care when writing about the death toll: 13 died in Derry on 30 January 1972, but a 14th victim died from a brain tumour several months later, so we should use a phrase such as “which led to 14 deaths”"

502,Bluffer’s Guide,"TM; beware of using phrases such as “a bluffer’s guide to crimewriting”, a headline that led to a legal complaint"
503,blunder,"one (of many) mentions of this word led to the following comment from a reader: “The term ‘blunder’ is used most frequently when referring to mistakes made in public services and this only serves to fuel the view commonly propagated by rightwing newspapers that the role of the public sector should be diminished and its functions handed over to private companies. I’m sure the Guardian does not endorse this view, but its use of language may imply that it does”"
504,Blu-ray,"TM; full name is Blu-ray Disc (not Disk), abbreviation BD"
505,Blu-Tack,TM
506,boat or ship?,"large, ocean-going vessels, eg liners, tankers and warships, are ships rather than boats, which is a term better suited to small vessels such as fishing boats, dinghys, lifeboats etc. Remember that “a ship can carry a boat, but a boat cannot carry a ship”."

The distinction can, however, be useful: compare “bored with Tunbridge Wells” (a person who finds Tunbridge Wells boring) and “bored of Tunbridge Wells” (a bored person who happens to live there, perhaps a neighbour of “disgusted of Tunbridge Wells”)"
537,Boris,"Some people (Arnie, Maggie, Iggy) have forenames that make them instantly recognisable, and Boris Johnson is one. This makes his name tempting for headline writers.

“Square brackets,” the grammarian said, “are used in direct quotes when an interpolation [a note from the writer or editor, not uttered by the speaker] is added to provide essential information.”

696,capitals,"“I am a poet: I distrust anything that starts with a capital letter and ends with a full stop” (Antjie Krog)

Times have changed since the days of medieval manuscripts with elaborate hand-illuminated capital letters, or Victorian documents in which not just proper names, but virtually all nouns, were given initial caps (a Tradition valiantly maintained to this day by Estate Agents).

A look through newspaper archives would show greater use of capitals the further back you went. The tendency towards lowercase, which in part reflects a less formal, less deferential society, has been accelerated by the explosion of the internet: some web companies, and many email users, have dispensed with capitals altogether.

Our style reflects these developments. We aim for coherence and consistency, but not at the expense of clarity. As with any aspect of style, it is impossible to be wholly consistent – there are almost always exceptions, so if you are unsure check for an individual entry in this guide. But here are the main principles:"

Please avoid cliches such as ‘sharing a joke’ and ‘in happier times’.

There is no need to put (left) after one of the names in a caption showing, say, Nelson Mandela and Mother Teresa or William Hague and Angelina Jolie.

825,child sexual abuse,"rather than “child sex”; so for example we would refer to a “child sexual abuse ring” rather than a “child sex ring”, but say “child sex offender” rather than “child sexual offender”.

Say child sexual abuse images or child abuse images rather than “child pornography”, “child porn” and especially the tabloid “kiddy porn”. The NSPCC says that such terms give “a misleading and potentially trivialising impression of what is a very serious crime”, and favours the term “child abuse images”.

Avoid using the term “historical” to describe sexual abuse crimes from the past. Survivors, particularly adults who were abused as children, feel the term undermines the long-lasting impact of the crimes. Try to date the crimes (year, decade etc) instead, or say they happened in the past eg “Detectives are investigating allegations of child sexual abuse from more than 30 years ago.” Exceptions may be necessary in court cases where specific wording is required. (See also abuse. )

A footnote with details about support services should be added to stories about child sexual abuse from a relevant selection of the following:

The NSPCC offers support to children on 0800 1111, and adults concerned about a child on 0808 800 5000. The National Association for People Abused in Childhood ( Napac ) offers support for adult survivors on 0808 801 0331.

905,Colombia,South American country that we frequently misspell as “Columbia”
906,colon,"Use between two sentences, or parts of sentences, where the first introduces a proposition that is resolved by the second, eg Fowler put it like this: to deliver the goods invoiced in the preceding words.

A colon, rather than a comma, should be used to introduce a quotation: “He was an expert on punctuation,” or to precede a list – “He was an expert on the following: the colon, the comma and the full stop.”

Use before quotes when the quote could stand on its own as a sentence. He said: “You’ll never take me alive.”

When a colon is used in a headline, the next word is usually lowercase, eg Osborne: there is no plan B. One exception to this rule is in web furniture where the colon comes after the title of a series, for example as in the headline “Digested week: Words mattered to Stephen Sondheim”. Similarly, in a standfirst after a descriptive tag such as “Exclusive” or “Analysis” the next word should take an initial cap. Another exception on the web is when the colon introduces a complete sentence in quotation marks, such as Maro Itoje: ‘Whenever England take the field we should win’

This 2010 example from the Guardian is an awful (but by no means isolated) example of the tendency to use a semicolon where only a colon will do (all the more unfortunate for distracting the reader from a funny sentence): “Here’s a task for the new coalition government; set up a Drumming Taskforce today, and appoint a Snare Tsar.”

We are in danger of losing the distinction between colon and semicolon; many writers seem to think they are interchangeable but to make it clear: they are not.

910,commando,plural commandos
911,commas,"Use a comma to help the reader by inserting breathing space into a sentence: “When the Dutch reflect on their performance in the World Cup final, they will not find it hard to see why their aggressive tactics lost them many friends in 2010.”

“The editor, Katharine Viner, is a woman of great vision” – commas if there is only one editor.

“The subeditor Amelia Hodsdon is all style and no substance” – no commas if there is more than one subeditor.

A misplaced comma can sabotage a sentence, as in this example from the paper: “Neocon economists often claim a large, black economy turbo-powers growth ...” (the writer was talking about a big black economy, not a big and black one, which is not the same at all).

A comma is also crucial to avoid ambiguity in examples such as this: “Part of the report will heavily criticise a so-called power culture among the Dublin bishops who have been accused of not taking the allegations seriously.” We should have inserted a comma after “bishops” to make clear that all the Dublin bishops have been accused; as published, the sentence implies that only some of the bishops have.

Cap up, however, when part of the name of a county (eg West Sussex, East Riding of Yorkshire), local authority area (North Somerset, South Gloucestershire), or province (East Java, North Sulawesi, etc).

Note the following: East End, West End (London), Middle East, Central America, North America, South America, Latin America"
929,Competition and Markets Authority,"formerly the Competition Commission (and yes, there is still only one)"

932,complainers,"the Scottish legal term for complainants. Always include a brief explanation for readers outside Scotland eg “... the complainers, the Scottish legal term for complainants, allege that ...”"
933,complaisant,obliging
934,complicit,"You can be complicit in a crime, for example, if you know about it but fail to report it"
935,"comprise, consist, compose or constitute?","Tricky, but to get these right, just remember that comprise or consist of mean “made up of” while compose and constitute mean “make up”.

So you might say a band comprises guitar, bass, drums and keyboards or that it consists of guitar, bass, drums and keyboards. You can also say the band is composed of those instruments. Alternatively, you could say guitar, bass, drums and keyboards compose or constitute the band.

The one thing to avoid, unless you want people who care about such things to give you a look composed of, consisting of and comprising mingled pity and contempt, is “comprised of”"
936,computer game,video game is preferable
937,concentration/death camps in Poland,should be referred to as “Nazi concentration/death camps in German-occupied Poland” (see entry on “Polish death camps”)

950,consortium,plural consortiums not consortia
951,constitution,lc as in the US constitution
952,Consuelo,"not Consuela; from a reader: “I really have had enough of show-off ignoramuses messing up my name. Consuelo is a Spanish abstract noun, masculine, invariable. Pilar and Mercedes are also Spanish female names derived, like Consuelo, from titles of the Virgin Mary”"
953,consult,not consult with
954,consumer price index (Australia),
955,consumer prices index (UK),"forms the basis for the government’s inflation target and other inflation-linked tools; CPI after first mention. But note, consumer price inflation (no ‘s’ on price)."
956,Consumers’ Association,"now known as Which?, after its magazine"
957,contagious,"generally refers to a disease that is spread via contact. If you’re not sure how a disease is spread, or if it is spread via several means, use infectious or transmissible instead"
958,container ship,"not a synonym for cargo ship. Container ships are usually easy to spot because of the containers above deck. Other kinds of cargo ship include bulk carriers, which transport goods such as grain, iron ore and coal in their holds"
959,contemporary,"of the same period, though often wrongly used to mean modern; a performance of Shakespeare in contemporary dress would involve Elizabethan costume, not 21st-century clothes"
960,contemptible,deserving contempt
961,contemptuous,displaying contempt
962,"continent, the",but mainland Europe is preferable
963,continual or continuous?,the former refers to things that recur repeatedly but not constantly; the latter indicates an uninterrupted sequence: “My car continually breaks down because the radiator leaks continuously”
964,contractions,"Do not overuse contractions such as aren’t, can’t, couldn’t, hasn’t, don’t, I’m, it’s, there’s and what’s (even the horrific “there’ve” has appeared); while they might make a piece more colloquial or easier to read, they can be an irritant and a distraction, and make a serious article sound frivolous. They also look horrible"
965,controversial,"overused, typically to show that the writer disapproves of something (“the government’s controversial free schools scheme”); like “famous”, it can normally be safely removed from copy to allow readers to make up their own minds"
966,convener,not convenor
967,conversion practices,preferable to the term conversion “therapy” when referring to organisations’ efforts to try to change a person’s sexuality or gender identity
968,conversions,"We give metric measures and convert on first mention only to imperial in brackets (exceptions: miles and pints); if a rough figure is given in metric, do not convert it into an exact figure in imperial, and vice versa, eg if someone says the towns are about 50km apart, convert to 30 miles, not “31.07 miles”; the same goes for rough amounts of currencies, though don’t round up £3.6bn to £4bn"
969,convertible,not -able
970,convince or persuade?,"Having convinced someone of the facts, you might persuade them to do something, although you can be persuaded to do something without necessarily being convinced that it’s the right thing"

988,coronavirus outbreak 2019-20,"The virus is officially called Sars-CoV-2 and this causes the disease Covid-19. However, for ease of communication we are following the same practice as the WHO and using Covid-19 to refer to both the virus and the disease in our general reporting. It can also continue to be referred to as the coronavirus."

995,councillor,"use as a description, not a title, eg the councillor Jacqueline Weaver, followed by Weaver at subsequent mentions, not Cllr Weaver"
996,councillor or counsellor?,"A councillor serves on a local council; a counsellor offers advice. Just to confuse everyone, a member of the privy council is a privy counsellor"
997,councils,"Only the placename takes a capital: Lancaster city council, London borough of Southwark, Kent county council, etc; it is normally sufficient to say Lancaster council, Southwark council, etc"
998,count ‘em,"cliche often seen in parenthesis after a number is mentioned. For example, an article referred to “the seminal Andrex puppy advent calendar with 25 – count ‘em – puppy pictures ... “"

1010,CPS,Crown Prosecution Service
1011,"Cradock, Fanny","(1909-94) TV chef, often misspelt as “Craddock”"
1012,"crapulent, crapulous","drunk; hence crapula , hangover"
1013,crash or collision,"both are more objective than, and therefore usually preferable to, the term accident when describing traffic incidents. Unless the full circumstances are known, say that vehicles collided, rather than that one vehicle crashed into another, but use common sense so as to avoid sentences such as: “The car and the pedestrian collided on the pavement”"
1014,creche,no accent
1015,credible,"believable, hence credibility; incredible means unbelievable"
1016,credulous,"gullible, hence credulity; incredulous means amazed"
1017,"creme brulee, creme fraiche",
1018,crescendo,"a gradual increase in loudness or intensity; musically or figuratively, it is the buildup to a climax, not the climax itself (we frequently get this wrong)"
1019,cretinism,"a medical condition, not a term of abuse"
1020,cricket,"leg-side, leg-spinner, off-spin, off-stump, silly mid-on, mid-off, etc, all hyphenated"
1021,Crimean Bridge,"the official name for the bridge between Russia and Crimea, which you can refer to informally as the Kerch bridge. It crosses the Kerch strait"

1024,crisscross,
1025,criterion,plural criteria
1026,critique,"a noun meaning review, rather than a verb meaning criticise"
1027,crocodile-infested,please avoid. You can say “crocodile-filled waters” instead
1028,Crombie,"TM; the company’s wool coats have been popular with, among others, the Confederate army in the 1860s and mods in the 1960s"

Each has a chief minister as head of government and a legislative assembly which can pass laws subject to royal assent through the privy council.

Do not confuse them with the 14 British overseas territories (BOTs)"

1039,"Cruz, Penélope",
1040,cryonics and cryogenics,"Cryonics is the broad term for the freezing of human or animal corpses in the hope of restoring them to life in future; cryogenics is the more specific scientific study of the production of very low temperatures and how materials behave at these temperatures. As an example, a person can announce they wish to be cryogenically frozen, but their decision may restart the debate about the ethics of cryonics"
1041,"cubism, cubist",
1042,Cub scouts,"boys (and now girls) aged from eight to 10, organised in packs but no longer known as “Wolf Cubs”; avoid dated “Dyb Dyb Dyb, Dob Dob Dob” jokes but if relevant, it is spelt thus (it stands for “do your best” and we will “do our best”), and not “Dib”"
1043,cuckoo clock,"originated in Germany, not Switzerland"
1044,cucumiform,cucumber-shaped
1045,cull,"means pick or choose as in “culled from the best authors”. It doesn’t mean killed, axed or massacred (though you cull sheep in order to kill them). So a jobs cull does not mean the same as mass sackings"
1046,Cultural Revolution,launched by Mao Zedong in China in 1966
1047,CULV,consumer ultra-low voltage
1048,cum,"Latin for “with”, seen in such placenames as Chorlton-cum-Hardy, and phrases such as cross-cum-shot (in football) and cookbook-cum-autobiography – unfortunately, we wrote “cookbook-come-autobiography”"
1049,Cumberland sausage,"It now has protected status, and must be made in Cumbria; hence capital C"
1050,"Cummings, EE","US poet (1894-1962) who, despite what many people think, used capitals in his signature – so don’t call him “ee cummings”"
1051,"Cup, FA",after first mention it is the Cup; but other cups are lc on second mention
1052,cupful,"The plural is cupfuls, as with spoonfuls, but it’s three cups full, three spoons full"
1053,curate’s egg,"Used nowadays to mean good in parts (“this was a curate’s egg of a match”), the expression originally, and more subtly, meant to deliberately gloss over the truth – the curate was trying to spare his bishop’s feelings, or perhaps his own embarrassment, when served a bad egg, by saying: “Oh no, My Lord, I assure you! Parts of it are excellent!” (cartoon in Punch, 9 November 1895)"
1054,curb,restrain; kerb pavement
1055,currencies,"for most currencies – for example yen, yuan, afghani – we spell out the full name rather than use a symbol or abbreviation, eg 100 yuan, 100,000 yen. Exceptions are the pound, the euro and dollars. For currencies we habitually refer to with their nationality, such as Swiss francs, you don’t need to keep repeating the nationality or, indeed, to state it at all if it is clear from the context whose currency you are referring to – just say 100 francs.

Whenever the whole word for a currency is used it is lc: euro, pound, sterling, dong, etc. Abbreviate dollars like this: $50 (US dollars); A$50 (Australian dollars); HK$50 (Hong Kong dollars); C$50 (Canadian dollars). In stories where there may be confusion between US dollars and the local dollar, say US$ for clarity.

Convert all foreign amounts to sterling in brackets at first mention, but use common sense – there is no need to put £500,000 in brackets after the phrase “I feel like a million dollars.”

Take care when converting old money to new: some of our attempts have been meaningless, in that they have ignored the relative value of sums involved. We said in an obituary, for example, that Ronnie Barker was paid £1 9s (£1.45) a week for his first job in 1947 – a comparison of average earnings would convert that to around £113 today.

Similarly, in converting the price of a “four shilling dish of rice and vegetables” in 1967 to 20p in today’s money we forgot to allow for its relative value; taking into account changes in the retail price index it would now be worth £2.23.

There are some excellent websites to assist with such conversions"
1056,currently,"“now” is usually preferable, if needed at all"
1057,cusp,"a place where two points meet (eg “on the cusp of Manchester and Salford”, “on the cusp of Taurus and Gemini”), which may be extended metaphorically to a place or time where two things or groups of things come into contact, as in this elegant example from the Review: “It was a world caught on the cusp between postwar recession, stasis and a dying moral code, and the colour, mobility and licence of the 60s.”

Writers who use cusp under the impression that it is a clever way to say on the brink of or about to (“on the cusp of adolescence”, “on the cusp of the final”, “tanker drivers are on the cusp of striking over a coming supermarket-led cut in their wages”, “the garlic was on the cusp of bursting into a constellation of white stars”) are, sadly, mistaken"
1058,custody,no longer used in cases involving the care of children; use child arrangements or residence instead
1059,"Customs, Revenue & Customs",(singular) but customs officers
1060,cutbacks,avoid; cuts will suffice
1061,C-word,"can be spelt out in full, but should be used only when relevant (for example in the trial of a footballer accused of calling a rival player a “black cunt”)"
1062,"cyberbully, cybercafe, cybercrime, cyberlocker, cybernetics, cyberpunk, cybersecurity, cybersex, cyberspace, cyberterrorism, cyberwar",
1063,"cyber-army, cyber-attack",
1064,Cyprus,"Cyprus, properly known as the Republic of Cyprus, joined the EU in 2004, 30 years after Turkey invaded the northern part of the island, which should be referred to as “Turkish-occupied northern Cyprus” (the self-styled “Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus” is recognised only by Turkey)"
1065,the Czech Republic,
1066,dachshund,
1067,Dad or dad?,"capital D if it’s just Dad, eg “I’ll have to ask Dad”; otherwise lowercase, eg “my dad was a dustman, what does your dad do?” etc"
1068,"dadaism, dadaist",
1069,Dáil Éireann,"lower house of parliament in the Republic of Ireland, normally just the Dáil"
1070,DaimlerChrysler,
1071,Dakar,capital of Senegal; Dhaka capital of Bangladesh
1072,dal,not dhal
1073,Dalai Lama,no abbreviation: he is always the Dalai Lama
1074,Dalek,"takes initial cap, whether used literally (as in referring to Doctor Who), or figuratively (as in describing, say, your boss)"
1075,"Dalí, Salvador",(1904-89) Spanish surrealist
1076,dancefloor,one word (thanks to Arctic Monkeys for this one)
1077,dangling participles,"(also known as hanging participles)

Avoid constructions such as “having died, they buried him”; the pitfalls are nicely highlighted in Mark Lawson’s novel Going Out Live, in which a TV critic writes: “Dreary, repetitive and well past the sell-by date, I switched off the new series of Fleming Faces.”

Another example, from a leading article: “Due out in January as a white paper, Ms Kelly may be unable to overcome Mr Blair’s apparent determination to stick with A-levels.”

And this particularly exotic dangling participle somehow found its way into the paper: “Though long-legged and possessing a lovely smile, gentleman journalists aren’t looking up her skirt and wouldn’t even if she weren’t gay”"
1078,danish pastry,
1079,Deraa,"Syrian city, 90km from Damascus, not to be confused with Darayya , a suburb of Damascus, also sometimes described as a city"
1080,Dar es Salaam,
1081,dark ages,
1082,darknet,
1083,dashcam,
1084,dashes,"A single dash can add a touch of drama – like this. But use sparingly.

A pair of dashes are an alternative to commas or brackets for parenthesis when you want to draw the reader’s attention to something surprising or unusual. An example from the paper of how not to do it: “Many neighbours in the block – which sits close to the banks of the Thames – were visibly shaken.” The block’s innocuous location does not need underlining with dashes. Commas would suffice.

Beware sentences – such as this one – that dash about all over the place – commas (or even, very occasionally, brackets) are often better; semicolons also have their uses.

Dashes should be en dashes rather than em dashes or hyphens"
1085,data,"takes a singular verb (like agenda), though strictly a plural; you come across datum, the singular of data, about as often as you hear about an agendum"
1086,"datacentre, dataset",
1087,dates,"Our style is: 21 July 2016 (day month year; no commas).

21 July-6 August, 6-10 August, etc.

In the 21st century but 21st-century boy; fourth century BC; AD2007, 2500BC, 10,000BC.

Use figures for decades: the 1960s, the swinging 60s, etc.

Should you have occasion to say 2016 out loud, for example in a podcast, pronounce it “twenty sixteen”, not “two thousand and sixteen”"
1088,"daughter of, son of","Think twice before referring to people in these terms. Often only the person’s father is described and such descriptions can smack of snobbery as well as sexism.

Simplistic labels may also be misleading: we published a clarification after calling Captain James Cook the son of a Scottish farm labourer. True enough, but Cook’s mother was a Yorkshire woman and he is a famous son of Yorkshire"
1089,"Davison, Emily",suffragette who died four days after stepping in front of George V’s horse at the 1913 Derby
1090,"daybreak, daydream",
1091,DayGlo,TM; but note the X-Ray Spex hit The Day the World Turned Day-Glo
1092,Day Kundi,province in Afghanistan
1093,"daylong, daytime","but month-long , year-long , night-time"
1094,day trip,"two words, eg Day Trip to Bangor by (trivia question) ... Fiddler’s Dram"
1095,“day zero”,"not Day Zero, in relation to water crises in Cape Town and elsewhere"
1096,D-day,"6 June 1944, or used figuratively (“Monday is D-day for the Blades’ promotion hopes”)"
1097,deaf ears,"Avoid or say “closed ears”; the phrase is not just a rather lazy cliche but offensive to many deaf people. For the same reason, do not use “dialogue of the deaf”: most deaf people are perfectly capable of conducting a dialogue using BSL and other sign languages. The term “deaf mute” is also outdated and offensive; “deaf”, where relevant, will suffice.

Note that a hearing aid is not a “deaf aid” (although we contrived to use the phrase in a crossword in August 2012)"
1098,deathbed,but death row
1099,debacle,"no accents; like farce and fiasco, to be used sparingly in news reporting"
1100,debatable,
1101,"Deben, Lord","Deben at second mention. If you are referring to things he did in the years before his peerage, for example while environment secretary, it is helpful to also point out his name is John Gummer"
1102,decades,"1950s, etc; use figures if you abbreviate: roaring 20s, swinging 60s, a woman in her 70s, the first reader’s email of the 00s (pronounced, unfortunately, “noughties”)"
1103,deceptively,"ambiguous (in one survey, half the respondents thought “deceptively easy” meant easy, and half thought it meant hard), and therefore best avoided – advice unlikely to be heeded, sadly, by estate agents"
1104,decimate,"nowadays used to mean destroy (yes, we know it originally meant to kill one in 10) See Latin"
1105,declarations,"lc, eg Laeken declaration on the future of Europe"
1106,decorations,"no need normally to put OBE, KCMG, etc after people’s names"
1107,decry,condemn; descry discover You only ever see descry when someone uses it wrongly to mean decry
1108,deep south,of the US
1109,defensible,
1110,"definite, definitely, definitive, definitively","“For me, this is definitely the definitive style guide”"
1111,defriend,or unfriend (Facebook)
1112,defuse,render harmless; diffuse spread about
1113,"Degas, Edgar",(1834-1917) French artist
1114,"de Gaulle, Charles",(1890-1970) French military leader and statesman; De Gaulle on second mention
1115,degrees,"like this: my sons all got firsts, but I only got a second – although it was a 2:1 – and I did go on to a master’s"
1116,deja vu,"defined as the phenomenon of having the strong sensation that an event or experience currently being experienced has already been experienced in the past (whether it has actually happened or not). So watching England underperforming and being knocked out of a major football tournament at an early stage, for example, might be said to induce a sense of deja vu"
1117,"Delevingne, Cara",
1118,Delhi,unless specifically referring to the small area of the city that is New Delhi
1119,delivery,"the arrival of a baby, letter or parcel; also widely found in such gruesome examples of marketing-speak as “delivering care” or “delivering quality and value”"
1120,Deloitte,"not Deloittes, Deloitte Consulting, or Deloitte & Touche"
1121,delphic,
1122,Delta Air Lines or Delta,not Delta Airlines
1123,deltas,"are, like other geographical features, lc: Nile delta, Okavango delta, etc"
1124,delusion or illusion?,"“That the sun moves round the Earth was once a delusion, and is still an illusion” (Fowler)"
1125,dementia,"not “senile dementia”.

We should take care to refer to a person or people with dementia, or living with dementia, not as a “dementia sufferer” or “victims of dementia”.

Dementia is an umbrella term that refers to various conditions. Some of the more common types of dementia include Alzheimer’s disease, vascular dementia, Lewy Body dementia, and fronto-temporal dementia (eg Pick’s disease). Respect people’s choices about how they identify themselves, for example as someone with Alzheimer’s disease rather than dementia"
1126,DeMille,", Cecil B (1881-1959) Hollywood producer and director; the B stood for Blount"
1127,"Democrat, Democratic","In American politics, Democrat is a noun, Democratic an adjective: Hillary Clinton is a Democrat, and a member of the Democratic party.

The distinction is important because the Republicans use “Democrat” as an adjective, eg “Democrat party”, in a pejorative way"
1128,the Democratic Republic of the Congo,"DRC on second mention; not to be confused with its smaller neighbour Congo-Brazzaville (which is also known as the Republic of the Congo); both countries border the Congo river. DRC, formerly the colony of Belgian Congo and then Zaire, is the second largest country in Africa by area and the fourth most populated"
1129,"denazify, denazification",
1130,"Dench, Dame Judi",not Judy
1131,Deng Xiaoping,
1132,denier,"one who denies, as in “Holocaust denier”; there is no such word as “denialist”.

The OED defines a sceptic as “a seeker of the truth; an inquirer who has not yet arrived at definite conclusions”, which is highly flattering to “climate change sceptics” who are literally in denial about the overwhelming scientific evidence and deny that climate change is happening or is caused by human activity, so denier is the more accurate, and our preferred, term. denier is also a unit of weight for fibre, eg 10-denier tights"
1133,"De Niro, Robert",
1134,denouement,no accent
1135,departments of state,"British government ministries (but not ministers) take initial caps, as follows:

Cabinet Office (but the cabinet) Department for Business and Trade (DBT) Department for Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) Department for Education (DfE) Department for Energy Security and Net Zero (DESNZ) Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) Department for International Development (DfID) – no longer exists after merging with the Foreign Office in 2020 Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities (DLUHC) Department for Science, Innovation and Technology (DSIT) Department for Transport (DfT) Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office, or Foreign Office (FCDO) Home Office Ministry of Defence (MoD) Ministry of Justice (MoJ) Northern Ireland Office Office of the Leader of the House of Commons Scotland Office, not Scottish Office Treasury Wales Office, not Welsh Office

Use the abbreviations in brackets sparingly, especially the clumsy ones: business department, culture and sport department, and so on are fine, or just the department, the ministry, etc.

Departments and ministries of other English-speaking countries also take an initial capital, eg US Department of State, Indian Ministry of Railways.

Departments and ministries of non-English-speaking countries are lc, eg French ministry of the interior, Iraqi foreign ministry"
1136,dependant,noun; dependent adjective; dependence His dependants were dependent on him for everything
1137,depositary,person; depository place
1138,deprecate,"express disapproval; depreciate reduce in value. Hence self-deprecating humour or remark, not “self-depreciating”"
1139,derby,as in Everton v Liverpool or Newbury FC v Thatcham Town; it is not normally necessary to include the word “local”
1140,de rigueur,the two Us are de rigueur

This is particularly true in areas such as health and education. So please take great care before adding the words British or UK to headlines and copy and make sure that what is being reported applies to the whole of the UK and not just England.

In terms of job titles, however, it is not strictly correct to refer to, for example, the health secretary in the UK government as the English health secretary. The most accurate formulation is to say they are the UK government health secretary. But also spell out, if it is relevant, where their responsibilities are confined to England. It is not incorrect to refer to the UK health secretary, but this can be misleading and should particularly be avoided if what is being discussed applies only to England. All this also applies to the UK government’s education secretary"
1156,diabetes,"a lifelong condition that causes a person’s blood sugar (glucose) level to become too high. The hormone insulin, produced by the pancreas, is responsible for controlling the amount of glucose in the blood.

There are two types of diabetes, type 1 and type 2, and it is important to distinguish between the two.

Type 1 diabetes, where the pancreas does not produce any insulin, comprises about 10% of cases but is the most common type of childhood diabetes. Type 1 is an auto-immune disease, cause unknown (although genetics is believed to play a part). Weight is not a factor

Type 2 diabetes, where the pancreas does not produce enough insulin or the body’s cells don’t react to insulin, comprises about 90% of adult cases. Obesity, lack of exercise and an unhealthy diet have contributed to an increase in the number of adults developing type 2 diabetes"

1352,elephant in the room,"Like governments and reality TV series, metaphors that we once welcomed into our lives as refreshing can become all too familiar, to the point of tedium – and this cliche is a fine example.

At its height, elephants were not only in the room, but had taken over the whole house: “elephants in the room” included trade figures, policy, lack of policy, climate change, Iraq, the US, Europe, anti-Americanism, men, women, single women, a new French football league, race, religion, Islam, Catholicism, Tessa Jowell, Andrew Neil, Jimmy Greaves, fatness, thinness, Stalinism, Hitler and Tony Blair’s departure from office.

The phrase seemed destined for the elephants’ graveyard but there is evidence that, used imaginatively, it may still be effective: “There’s only so long they can ignore this elephant in the room [the Iraq war] before it takes a dump on the carpet” (Gary Younge, 5 July 2010); and, from the same writer: “Money in American politics was already an elephant in the room.

But nowadays if you say “he emulated Thatcher”, everyone will think you mean that he succeeded, so you do need to qualify it: “He sought to emulate Thatcher, but ended up doing a poor imitation of Major”"
1377,enamoured of,not by or with
1378,enclave,"a piece of land totally surrounded by a foreign territory, eg San Marino and Vatican City, both enclaved within Italy; an exclave is politically attached to a larger piece of land but not physically conterminous with it because of surrounding foreign territory, eg the Azerbaijani exclave of Nakhichivan, which is is bounded by Armenia, Iran and Turkey"

1399,epicentre,"point on the Earth’s surface directly above the focus of an earthquake or underground explosion; frequently misused to mean the centre or focus itself and is also not a synonym for “dead centre”.

After one of our misuses in 2010 a reader (for more than 60 years) wrote: “How is it that so many highly educated people, whose business is words and communication, do not understand that a prefix such as epi is there for a purpose: it changes the meaning of the root word”"
1400,epilepsy,"A person with epilepsy might have a seizure, rather than a fit.

Seizures are epileptic, people are not – we do not define people by their medical condition; so say (if relevant) “Joe Bloggs, who has epilepsy” not “Joe Bloggs, an epileptic”"

1424,Ethio-jazz,
1425,Ethiopian and Eritrean names,"Ethiopian and Eritrean people are usually given a first name followed by their father’s first name. As such, the second name does not function in the same way as a western surname and people should be referred to by their first name on second mention, eg the athlete Kenenisa Bekele becomes Kenenisa thereafter. There can be exceptions to this – a person may always be referred to by their first and second names together – so it is worth checking. Also, people are sometimes given their grandfather’s first name as a third name, but this tends to function in a similar way to a western middle name and is not included in everyday usage"

1477,eye-watering,"The pace at which a fresh metaphor becomes a tired cliche seems to have increased in recent years; this one saw a huge increase in 2009 – although curiously, while “eye-watering” is only ever applied to money (“eye-watering sums”), its adverbial near relative is more versatile (“an eye-wateringly beautiful woman”, “an eye-wateringly sharp sauvignon” and so on). The danger, as ever, is that the expression loses its force from overuse"

I know everyone knows this, but I can’t think of an original way to start so I am going to say it anyway.

You don’t know this? I do. That shows I am clever and know lots of stuff you don’t. Reich famously declined to continue in academia, preferring to support himself via a series of blue-collar jobs.

You don’t know this? I do. That shows I am clever and know lots of stuff you don’t.

From a reader: “Please can you rein in the many writers who insist on dropping the word famously into their copy ... as in famously overused, famously redundant or famously not really famous at all.”

A preferable alternative to “famously” is “memorably”, which at least suggests that you remember it, rather than assuming that everyone does or should"

1622,foreign accents,"Use accents on French, German, Portuguese, Spanish and Irish Gaelic words – and, if at all possible, on people’s names in any language, eg Sven-Göran Eriksson (Swedish), Béla Bartók (Hungarian).

A notable exception in France is the National Rally leader, Marine Le Pen (uppercase L).

In Belgium, on the other hand, the Van is often uppercase even when the name is full out, as, for example, in the case of the former president of the European Council Herman Van Rompuy. The Italian De or Di is normally uppercase, eg Antonio Di Natale.

Remember that many names have become part of the English language: Geneva is the English name for the city that Switzerland’s French speakers refer to as Genève and its German speakers call Genf.

Accordingly, we opt for locally used names, with these main exceptions (the list is not exhaustive, apply common sense): Archangel, Basel, Berne, Brittany, Catalonia, Cologne, Dunkirk, Florence, Fribourg, Genoa, Gothenburg, Hanover, Lombardy, Milan, Munich, Naples, Normandy, Nuremberg, Padua, Piedmont, Rome, Sardinia, Seville, Sicily, Syracuse, Turin, Tuscany, Venice, Zurich.

The late Muammar Gaddafi renamed Libya “The Great Socialist People’s Libyan Arab Jamahiriyya”, but it never really caught on."
1626,foreign political parties,"In general, we use the English translation of a political party if (a) that is how it is most commonly known in the English-speaking world, or (b) the party’s name in its own language is not easy for readers to translate themselves. Otherwise, we use the name of the party in its own language. All initialisms are in the party’s own language."
1627,Germany,"Christian Democratic Union, or Christian Democrats (CDU); (Christlich Demokratische Union Deutschlands, in German) Social Democratic party, or Social Democrats (SPD); (Sozialdemokratische Partei Deutschlands, in German) Alternative für Deutschland (AfD) Stand up (Aufstehen)"

1632,foreign words and phrases,"Italicise, with roman translation in brackets, if it really is a foreign word or phrase and not an anglicised one, in which case it is roman with no accents (exceptions: exposé, lamé, paté, résumé, roué). Remember Orwell: do not use a foreign word where a suitable English equivalent exists"
1633,forensic,is not a synonym for scientific. It derives from forum (Latin for court) and that is what it means: all evidence in court is forensic. A forensic scientist is one whose work is done for legal purposes (so a page 1 headline in which we referred to “new forensic evidence” should have said “new scientific evidence”). Forensic medicine means medical jurisprudence
1634,"foresee, foreseeable",
1635,forests,"take initial capital, eg Black Forest, Epping Forest, New Forest"
1636,forest fires,"in the UK; elsewhere, use the term that is most common, eg bushfires in Australia, wildfires in the US. If you’re not sure about other countries, use wildfires as the default"
1637,forever,continually: he is forever changing his mind

1644,former Soviet republic,"this term can be used for Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Estonia, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Latvia, Lithuania, Moldova, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Ukraine and Uzbekistan, where relevant to the story, but not just as a convenient shorthand for describing independent countries that have histories and identities outside of the USSR"
1645,Formica,TM
1646,formula,"plural formulas , but formulae in a scientific context"
1647,Formula One,in copy; F1 is fine in headlines and standfirsts
1648,fortuitous,"by chance, not by good fortune. The same football commentators who ruled that deflections must always be described as “wicked” also decided that fortunate or lucky does not sound as impressive as fortuitous.

If we use the word correctly, it is entirely fortuitous"

1668,free schools,"Even if you disapprove of them, there is no need to use quotation marks or call them “so-called free schools” in news stories.

Free schools are outside local authority oversight, not “local authority control”. No schools are directly under local authority control, although local authorities oversee admissions and standards at some schools free solo climbing, free solo climber climbing without ropes or protection.

1686,fuchsia,a word frequently misspelt (in the Guardian and elsewhere) as “fuschia”; it may help to note that it is named after a botanist called Fuchs
1687,fuck,"not “a good, honest old-fashioned Anglo-Saxon word” (as it is often described) because there is no such thing as an Anglo-Saxon word (they spoke Old English) and, more important, its first recorded use dates from 1278.

1692,fully vaccinated,"Please take care to explain what fully vaccinated means in relation to Covid-19 immunisation (eg two jabs and a booster or third dose for an eligible cohort of adults) if it is used, which would only be if it’s pertinent to the story. Otherwise use vaccinated for people who have had as much protection as they are eligible for and unvaccinated or partially vaccinated for those who haven’t"
1693,fulsome,"Not a fancy word for full, it indicates cloying, lavish excess, as in this eloquent description in the London Review of Books, by Rosemary Hill, of books about Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother: “His biography was pious to a degree and, like his equally fulsome edition of her letters, much too long.”

This sorely misused word is most often seen in the phrase “fulsome praise”, which should not be used in a complimentary sense"

1720,gatecrash,
1721,Gategate,"The hapless quintet who broke into Democratic headquarters at the Watergate building in Washington DC in 1972 can have had no idea of the forces they were unleashing – forces that in due course led to the resignation of President Richard Nixon, and began a proud tradition of inane journalism that shows no sign of diminishing 40 years later.

Examples range from the mildly droll – Gatecrashergate, Henry Gatesgate (also known as Stupidgate) – to the utterly feeble (Sexy Photo Gate).

Among numerous other instances are Bertiegate, Betsygate, Billygate, Camillagate (not to be confused with Dianagate, also known as Squidgygate), Cheriegate, Closetgate, Contragate, Fajitagate, Flakegate, at least two Grannygates, Hobnobgate, Irangate, Iraqgate, Irisgate (it is compulsory for stories about this to be headlined “And here’s to you, Mrs Robinson... “), Katrinagate, Koreagate, Monicagate, at least two cases of Nannygate, Nipplegate, Partygate, Smeargate, various Strippergates, Toiletgate, three different outbreaks of Troopergate, and Whitewatergate.

Sporting gates include Beachballgate, Bloodgate, Buttongate, Chicanegate, Crashgate, Handgate/Henrygate/Thierrygate, Liargate, Pizzagate, Tevezgate and, of course, Tigergate.

Occasionally, as with Climategate or Plebgate, such an ephithet may be useful as a way to pull together a lot of material on the same subject, but most gates are lazy and more likely to put readers off than engage them"

1732,"Geldof, Bob","has an honorary KBE but, as an Irish citizen, is not eligible to use the style Sir so please don’t call him “Sir Bob Geldof”"
1733,gender issues,"Our use of language reflects our values, as well as changes in society. Phrases such as career girl or career woman, for example, are outdated (more women have careers than men) and patronising (there is no male equivalent).

So we use actor or comedian for women as well as men, not actress or comedienne (but waiter and waitress are acceptable – at least for the moment); firefighter, not fireman; PC, not WPC (police forces have abandoned the distinction), postal workers, not postmen, etc.

Avoid terms such as businessmen, housewives, male nurse, woman driver, woman (lady!) doctor, etc, which reinforce outdated stereotypes. If you need to use an adjective, it is female and not “woman” in such phrases as female bishops, female MPs, female president.

Do not gratuitously describe a woman as a “mother-of-three”: family details and marital status are only relevant in stories about families or marriage.

Use humankind or humanity rather than mankind, a word that, as one of our readers points out, “alienates half the population from their own history”. Similarly, avoid man hours or man years, instead say eg the equivalent of one person working for 1,000 years.

Never say “his” to cover men and women: use his or her, or a different construction; in sentences such as “a teacher who beats his/her pupils is not fit to do the job”, there is usually a way round the problem – in this case, “teachers who beat their pupils ...”

Men (rarely women – funny, that) who occasionally question our policy and accuse us of “political correctness” may care to reflect on the fact that Fowler’s used to list such “established feminine titles” as adventuress, authoress, editress, executrix, giantess, huntress, inspectress, Jewess, poetess, procuress, quakeress, songstress, tailoress, wardress; it also proposed new ones such as danceress and doctress (“everyone knows the inconvenience of being uncertain whether a doctor is a man or a woman”)"
1734,gender reassignment,"Use instead of “sex change”. Gender reassignment is one of the nine protected characteristics under the 2010 Equality Act. The others are: age, disability, marriage and civil partnership, pregnancy and maternity, race, religion or belief, sex, sexual orientation"

Abbreviate to gen X, gen Y, gen Z or gen Alpha"
1740,Geneva conventions,"(not convention); four treaties, last revised and ratified in 1949, which with three more recently adopted protocols set out international standards for the humanitarian treatment of prisoners of war and civilians caught up in war.

The refugee convention of 1951, though signed in Geneva, is not part of the Geneva conventions. It is the key legal document in defining who is a refugee, their rights and the legal obligations of states"

1747,gerund,"Nothing to be frightened of. Think of it as a verb used as a noun: I like running, smoking is bad for your health, etc. You are supposed to use a possessive: I was worried by his smoking, rather than I was worried by him smoking. In practice, many people – yes, even journalists – don’t bother"
1748,ghetto,plural ghettoes

1770,“global gag rule”,"Use in quotes at first mention to make clear it is not the actual name of the policy.

1787,gong,"strikes the wrong tone in reporting about awards and medals (for example we had people winning “gongs” at the RIBA architecture awards); can be effective used disparagingly (“the more gongs the prime minister doles out to donors and party hacks, the more he stands accused of cronyism”)"

1805,grammar,"“It will be proved to thy face that thou hast men about thee that usually talk of a noun and a verb, and such abominable words as no Christian ear can endure to hear” (William Shakespeare, Henry VI Part 2)

Ambrose Bierce defined grammar as “a system of pitfalls thoughtfully prepared for the feet of the self-made man”. He had a point. Generations of schoolchildren were taught grammar as an arbitrary set of dos and don’ts laid down by people who knew, or thought they knew, best.

Nowadays, grammar might be more helpfully defined as the set of rules followed by speakers of a language: for example, why in English we say “I went out” and not “I out went”. Using correct grammar is a way to communicate effectively, not to feel superior to other people because you know what a conjunction is.

Don’t feel too downhearted if you were taught grammar badly, or not at all; as the linguist Steven Pinker says: “A preschooler’s tacit knowledge of grammar is more sophisticated than the thickest style manual”"
1806,"Grammer, Kelsey",actor fondly remembered as Dr Frasier Crane
1807,grandad,but granddaughter
1808,grandee,"has become a cliche applied to almost any long-serving politician (though not, so far, to John Prescott); it sounds vaguely, and inappropriately, deferential"
1809,grandparent,"Mention this status only when relevant: leave “battling grannies” and similar examples of ageism and sexism to the tabloids; in particular we should avoid such patronising drivel as “How this 55-year-old granny came to earn $25m a year” (on the front page of the paper) – just in case anyone still didn’t get the message, the front of G2 said: “She’s five foot two, she’s a grandmother and she earns $25m a year”.

Our policy on this matter prompted the Spectator columnist Rod Liddle to ask: “Why Has The Word ‘Grandmother’ Been Banned By The Guardian?” It hasn’t"

1820,Greek royalty,"As the Greek monarchy was abolished in 1973 we should avoid using titles such as king, queen, crown prince and princess, even though family members continue to do so. We can, however, refer to Constantine as the former king.

1934,"HDTV, HD DVD",
1935,head-butt,but butt should normally suffice
1936,"headdress, headhunter, headroom",but head-on
1937,headed or heading?,The former is most commonly used as past tense (“we headed for the exit”) and the latter as present participle (“we are heading in the right direction”); try not to mix them up – “we are headed in the right direction” sounds inelegant at best
1938,headlines,"What makes a great, or at least memorable, headline? They can be historic (“Man walks on Moon”), campaigning (“He lied and lied and lied”), classical (“Between Cilla and Charybdis”), subtle (“Flo quiets the Dons”), funny (“Super Caley go ballistic – Celtic are atrocious”), notorious (“Gotcha!”), scurrilous (“Zip me up before you go-go”), or downright absurd (“Freddie Starr ate my hamster”). There is no magic formula but here are a few guidelines.

Use active verbs where possible, particularly in news headlines: “Editor updates style guidelines” is much better than “Style guidelines updated”.

Avoid tabloid cliches such as bid, brand, dub and slam, and their broadsheet counterparts such as insist, signal and target. Imagining that you are describing an event, in words, to real people, is a good antidote to journalese: no one in a pub says “Did you see that Brown slammed Blair in a dramatic power bid?”

Just as we would in copy, we need to take care with words such as debacle, farce and fiasco, especially when combined, which we contrived to do in the headline “Hips fiasco descends into farce”– the fact that “Hips farce descends into fiasco” would work just as well tells you something is probably wrong here.

Strive to be fresh: tired plays on the phrase “Mind the gap”, heard only occasionally these days by passengers on the London underground, have become tedious, as well as either baffling or infuriating to readers who do not happen to live in the capital.

Take care over ambiguity: “Landmine claims dog UK arms firm”, which appeared in the paper, contains so many successive nouns, some of which may or may not be verbs, that you have to read it several times to work out what it means.

Exclamation marks – look, I’ve written something funny! – should never be used. Question marks are also to be avoided, as are quotation marks, unless essential to signify a quote or for legal reasons. And we should resist the temptation to save space by replacing “and” with a comma: “Blair and Brown agree euro deal” not “Blair, Brown agree euro deal”.

Puns are fine – “Where there’s muck there’s bras”, about a farmer’s wife who started a lingerie business from a barn, was voted headline of the year by our staff – but do not overuse, or resort to tired puns such as “flushed with success” (this story has got a plumber in it). It is possible to try just a little too hard (“To baldly grow where no mane’s grown before”). In the 1970s and 80s the Guardian suffered from a reputation for excruciating puns; today, we want to be known for clever, original and witty headlines.

Unexpected twists, or subtle plays on words and phrases, show the subeditor’s craft at its best: a power failure in a theatre became, in the Guardian, “Bad lights stop play”. A light touch can work beautifully: “Drop dead, gorgeous”, on a story about office jealousy, added one comma to a well-known film title to create the perfect headline. When Tate Modern exhibited a giant sun, to create its own indoor climate, the beautiful headline written by the Guardian’s Steve Chamberlain – “But is it weather?” (a rare example of a question mark being required) – deserved to be framed and exhibited in a gallery in its own right.

Be careful when making references to popular culture: “Mrs Culpepper’s lonely hearts club banned” works, because most people are familiar with the Beatles’ Sgt Pepper album, but allusions to your favourite obscure prog-rock LP are likely to pass over most readers’ heads. Long after most people had forgotten the 1960s movie Charlie Bubbles, tabloid sports subeditors continued to mystify their readers by using the headline “Charlie bubbles” whenever anyone called Charlie scored a goal. “Book lack in Ongar”, about a shortage of resources in Essex libraries, remains one of the all-time great headlines, but it only works if you get the reference to John Osborne’s 1956 play Look Back in Anger (or at least it did until Oasis helpfully recorded a song called Don’t Look Back in Anger).

It’s time for some formulaic headlines to be given a decent burial, or at least a long rest. “The kids are alright” (based on a song by the Who, and subsequently a film) crops up, with minor variations, on a weekly and sometimes daily basis in British newspapers: “The kids are alright online”, “The kids are all right (and left)”, “The kids are all right, left and centre”, and so on.

Even more ubiquitous are “Size isn’t everything” and its close relative “Size doesn’t matter”, used to refer to a car (in two different newspapers), school uniforms, the actor Simon Callow’s height, a hotel in Turkey, new houses, national economies, motorbikes, a footballer, the gallery following a golf tournament, and – once – penis size.

The ever-popular “Brighton rocks” and its variations are an allusion, still common, to the Graham Greene novel and subsequent film, both more than 50 years old. How many people still understand the reference? “So lucky, lucky, lucky”, a recent headline we used above a photograph of Kylie Minogue, quoted lyrics from a hit she had in nearly 20 years ago. How many of our readers would be aware of this? You have to use your judgment.

If you are quoting, be sure to get it right. “Talkin’ about their generation”, from a classic 1960s song by the Who, fails as a headline because it literally lacks rhythm (it should be “Talkin’ ‘bout”). We claimed that Millwall fans sing “No one likes us and we don’t care”; they don’t sing that, and the mistake made it look as if we don’t care.

As always, the most important thing is to think of the readers and remember that we are writing headlines for their benefit, not for our own amusement or to show how clever we are."

1948,heatstroke,
1949,heatwave,

In all the above cases, the present tense is heave or heaves, so it would be “they heave into view”"

1952,hectares,"should be converted to acres in brackets at first mention by multiplying by 2.47, so 10 hectares is 24.7 acres; to convert acres to hectares, multiply by 0.4, so 10 acres is 4 hectares (we get this the wrong way round embarrassingly often)"

1984,high net worth individual,"classification used by the financial services industry. The figure differs by institution and region, but the most commonly quoted is $1m in liquid financial assets (below that you are merely “affluent”).

2000,historic or historical?,"A historic event is notable, a historical event simply something that happened in the past. So someone might be accused of historical crimes that happened years earlier.

However, avoid using the term historical to describe sexual abuse crimes from the past. Survivors, particularly adults who were abused as children, feel the term undermines the long-lasting impact of the crimes. Try to date the crimes (year, decade etc) instead, or say they happened in the past eg “Detectives are investigating allegations of child sexual abuse from more than 30 years ago.” Exceptions may be necessary in court cases where specific wording is required.

Note that it’s “a” not “an”, unless directly quoting: “an historic” is considered old-fashioned, and in modern English “a historic”, “a hotel” and so on sound more natural. Before silent H, the opposite applies: an heir, an honest man, etc"

Follow traditional Guardian style in leading articles (but not other comment pieces and columns on leader pages): use honorifics after first mention, unless writing about an artist, author, journalist, musician, sportsperson, criminal or dead person; use Ms for women on second mention unless they have expressed a preference for Miss or Mrs.

So: at first mention David Cameron, Harriet Harman, Sir Richard Branson, Lady Warsi, Prof John Wells, Dr Bill Bailey, the Rev George Herbert; thereafter Mr Cameron, Ms Harman, Sir Richard, Lady Warsi, Prof Wells, Dr Bailey, Mr Herbert, etc.

2048,Hope Not Hate,
2049,hopefully,"

Like many other adverbs, such as frankly, happily, honestly and sadly, hopefully can be used as a “sentence adverb” indicating the writer’s view of events – “hopefully, we will reach the summit” – or as a “manner adverb” modifying a verb – “we set off hopefully for the summit”.

2066,hove,"past tense and past participle of heave used in a nautical context, literally or metaphorically (they hove into view, hove up the anchor and hove alongside); so do not write, for example, “Woods and Mickelson had only to hove into view” (should be heave) or “Sweeney Todd now hoves into view” (should be heaves).

In other contexts, use heaved: she heaved a sigh of relief as he heaved the weapon away"

2086,hyphens,"Our style is to use one word wherever possible. Hyphens tend to clutter up text (particularly when the computer breaks already hyphenated words at the end of lines). This is a widespread trend in the language: “The transition from space to hyphen to close juxtaposition reflects the progressive institutionalisation of the compound,” as Rodney Huddleston puts it, in his inimitable pithy style, in his Introduction to the Grammar of English.

Inventions, ideas and new concepts often begin life as two words, then become hyphenated, before finally becoming accepted as one word. Why wait? “Wire-less” and “down-stairs” were once hyphenated, and some old-fashioned souls still hyphenate e-mail.

Words such as chatroom, frontbench, gameplan, housebuyer and standup are all one word in our publications, as are thinktank (not a tank that thinks), longlist (not necessarily a long list) and shortlist (which need not be short).

There is no need to use hyphens with most compound adjectives, where the meaning is clear and unambiguous without: civil rights movement, financial services sector, work inspection powers, etc. Hyphens should, however, be used to form short compound adjectives, eg two-tonne vessel, three-year deal, 19th-century artist. Also use hyphens where not using one would be ambiguous, eg to distinguish “black-cab drivers come under attack” from “black cab-drivers come under attack”. A missing hyphen in a review of Chekhov’s Three Sisters led us to refer to “the servant abusing Natasha”, rather than “the servant-abusing Natasha”.

Do not use hyphens after adverbs ending in -ly, eg a hotly disputed penalty, a constantly evolving newspaper, genetically modified food, etc, but hyphens are needed with short and common adverbs, eg ever-forgiving family, much-loved character, well-established principle of style (note, however, that in the constructions “a character who is much loved” and “the principles of style are well established” there is no need to hyphenate). - When an adverb can also be an adjective (eg hard), the hyphen is required to avoid ambiguity – it’s not a hard, pressed person, but a hard-pressed one; an ill-prepared report, rather than an ill, prepared one.

Use a hyphen in verbs where necessary to stop this kind of thing happening:

Motorists told: don’t panic buy petrol

(While not panicking may well have been advisable, they had actually been told not to panic-buy.)

Prefixes such as macro, mega, micro, mini, multi, over, super and under rarely need hyphens: examples are listed separately. Follow Collins when a word or phrase is not listed"

2089,ice-cream,
2090,Icelandic names,"Icelandic people are referred to by their first names on second mention eg the former prime minister Jóhanna Sigurðardóttir, then Jóhanna thereafter. This is because last names are typically patronymic, indicating the person is the son or daughter of the father, and are not, like most western last names, an indication of family lineage eg Jóhanna Sigurðardóttir is Jóhanna, the daughter (dóttir) of Sigurðar Egill Ingimundarson. There are occasional exceptions to this so it is always worth checking."
2091,iconic,"in danger of losing all meaning after an average three appearances a day in the Guardian and Observer, employed to describe anything vaguely memorable or well-known – from hairdressers, storm drains in Los Angeles and the Ferrero Rocher TV ads to Weetabix, the red kite and the cut above the eye David Beckham sustained after being hit by a flying boot kicked by Sir Alex Ferguson. Our advice, even if our own writers rarely follow it, is to show a little more thought, and restraint, in using this term"
2092,icons,"A selection of the things described in the Guardian as “iconic” in a heady fortnight in 2010: Archaeopteryx bluefin tuna Castro’s cigar David Beckham wearing an anti-Glazer scarf Grace Kelly in casual wear Imperial War Museum Nigel Slater Mad Men Variety the John Hughes films Breakfast Club, Ferris Bueller’s Day Off and Weird Science Shepard Fairey’s Obama Hope design the parliamentary constituency of Hove Brandenburg Gate Bach’s St Matthew Passiona community-owned wind turbine Kraft cheese slices salmon farming the blue and white stripes of Cornishware pottery Penarth Pavilion, Cardiff the Norwegian church and Pierhead Building in Cardiff Bay a multimillion-pound arena in Leeds a “rock-built engine house at Bottalack near St Just” the Royal Albert Hallwind turbines (“iconic renewable energy technology”) Wembley Arena the video for Kylie Minogue’s Can’t Get You Out of My Head"

2100,I’m a Celebrity,… Get Me Out of Here!
2101,"iMac, iPad, iPhone, iPod, iTunes","The trend for sticking an “i” in front of new products to make them seem whizzy began in 1997, when Ken Segall, a creative director at Apple, came up with the iMac name when the computer was in development. “The i meant internet,” Segall says. “But it also meant individual, imaginative and all the other things it came to stand for.” Apple’s founder, Steve Jobs, initially pooh-poohed the name"
2102,Imax,"cinemas, so named in 1968"
2103,immaculate conception,has nothing to do with the birth of Jesus: it is the doctrine that Mary herself was conceived by her mother (St Anne) without the stain of original sin. The virgin birth is the doctrine of Christ’s birth without a human father. This is one of our most frequent errors
2104,immigrate,"to arrive in a country; emigrate to leave one Hence immigrant, immigration, emigrant, emigration"
2105,Immigration and Nationality Directorate,may be called “the immigration service”
2106,immune to,not immune from
2107,impact,"is best used as a noun, not a verb: “could potentially impact” is more eloquently and concisely expressed as “might affect”; affect or have an effect on are invariably preferable to “impact” or “impact on”"

2110,"impinge, impinging",
2111,imply or infer?,"To imply is to suggest; to infer is to conclude.

Homer: “What are you inferring?” Lisa: “I’m not inferring anything. You infer; I imply.” Homer: “Well that’s a relief.”

2181,introducing people,"Do not use the following construction to introduce a speaker or a subject: “Foreign secretary Philip Hammond said ... ” Use the definite article and commas to separate the job from the name, like this: “Philip Hammond, the foreign secretary ... ” (there is only one person with this specific post).

Commas are not used if the description is more general and could apply to more than one person, like this: “The health minister Norman Lamb said ... ” (there are several health ministers); or like this: “The Liberal Democrat MP Norman Lamb said ... ” (after the 2010 election, there were 57).

Another example: “Michael Billington, the Guardian’s theatre critic, gave his verdict ... ” is correct; “The theatre critic Michael Billington gave his verdict ... ” is fine as well"

2202,"ironic, ironically","Do not use when what you mean is strange, coincidental, paradoxical or amusing (if you mean them say so, or leave it up to the reader to decide). There are times when ironic is right but too often it is misused, as in this typical example from the paper: “Santini’s Tottenham won 2-0 at Nottingham Forest, ironic really with the north London club having a big interest in Forest’s Republic of Ireland midfielder Andy Reid...” (not that sport are the only, or biggest, offenders).

As Kingsley Amis put it: “The slightest and most banal coincidence or point of resemblance, or even just- perceptible absence of one, unworthy of a single grunt of interest, gets called ‘ironical’.” The idiotic “post-ironic”, which Amis would be glad he did not live to see, is banned"

2205,-ise,"not -ize at end of word, eg maximise, synthesise (exception: capsize)"
2206,Islam,"means “submission to the will of God”.

Muslims should never be referred to as “Mohammedans”, as 19th-century writers did. It causes serious offence because they worship God, not the prophet Muhammad.

“Allah” is Arabic for “God”. Both words refer to the same concept: there is no major difference between God in the Old Testament and Allah in Islam. Therefore it makes sense to talk about “God” in an Islamic context and to use “Allah” in quotations or for literary effect.

The holy book of Islam is the Qur’an (not Koran)"
2207,Islamic,a synonym for the Muslim religion when used as an adjective eg Islamic art. It should not be used to describe people.

2214,issue,not a synonym for problem (“she has stylebook issues”)
2215,Italian royalty,"Since the Italian monarchy was abolished through a referendum in 1946, we should not use titles such as king, queen, prince, and princess, even where descendants of the aristocracy continue to do so.

However, the Italian constitution allows the use of nobiliary particles acquired before 1922 as part of the surname. For example, the grandson of King Umberto II is named Emanuele Filiberto di Savoia, where “Di Savoia” is his surname. Other examples include Luca Cordero di Montezemolo (a businessman), referred to as Cordero di Montezemolo on second mention"
2216,italics,"Use roman for titles of books, films, etc; the only exceptions are the Review and the Observer, which by special dispensation are allowed to ignore the generally sound advice of George Bernard Shaw:

“1. I was reading The Merchant of Venice. 2. I was reading ‘The Merchant of Venice’. 3. I was reading The Merchant of Venice . The man who cannot see that No 1 is the best-looking, as well as the sufficient and sensible form, should print or write nothing but advertisements for lost dogs or ironmongers’ catalogues: literature is not for him to meddle with.”

Use italics for foreign words and phrases (with roman translation in brackets); poetry and scientific names.

2227,Jacuzzi,"TM; named after its US inventors, Roy and Candido Jacuzzi; call it a whirlpool bath unless you’re sure it really is a Jacuzzi"
2228,jail,"not gaol (inexplicably, the Guardian persisted with this style well into the 1980s, long after everyone else had changed)"

2233,jargon,"Originally jargon was “the inarticulate utterance of birds, or a vocal sound resembling it; twittering, chattering”.

The modern sense – defined as “mode of speech abounding in unfamiliar terms, or peculiar to a particular set of persons, as the language of scholars or philosophers, the terminology of a science or art, or the cant of a class, sect, trade, or profession” (OED) – dates from the 17th century.

Bill Bryson describes jargon thus: “The practice of never calling a spade a spade when you might instead call it a manual earth-restructuring implement”"

2237,Jehovah’s Witness,
2238,jejune,"naive or unsophisticated, not necessarily anything to do with youth. Although jeune means young in French, jejune is derived from the Latin for fasting and originally meant deficient or scanty. The OED’s first listing of it in the modern sense is from George Bernard Shaw’s Arms and the Man, published in 1898

2249,jihadi,"noun (plural jihadis) and adjective

Only use this term in the most general sense to apply to a Muslim pursuing jihad, in particular the first two kinds of struggle. If referring to the third struggle, jihadist is preferable (see below)."
2250,jihadist,"noun and adjective

A person who believes in jihadism, ie, the fundamentalist pursuit of violent jihads to defend the Islamic faith. It can be used to refer to members of formal organisations, such as Islamic State or al-Qaida, as well as those who are not.

Supreme court: Lord Smith, Lady Brown, thereafter Smith, Brown

If a judge appears in a court higher or lower than the one in which they usually work they retain their existing title, eg if Lady Justice Brown of the appeal court appears in the supreme court she does not become Lady Brown; likewise, if she appears in the high court she does not become Ms or Mrs Justice Brown. If the honorific of a female high court judge cannot be ascertained, use Ms.

In Scotland, judges are always Lord or Lady. So Lord Smith, Lady Brown. Sheriffs’ first names are given at first mention, so Sheriff Robert Smith, thereafter Smith.​"

Some people object to, say, the use of “decimate” to mean destroy on the grounds that in ancient Rome it meant to kill every 10th man; some of them are also likely to complain about so-called split infinitives, a prejudice that goes back to 19th-century Latin teachers who argued that as you can’t split infinitives in Latin (they are one word) you shouldn’t separate “to” from the verb in English. Others might even get upset about our alleged misuse of grammatical “case” (including cases such as dative and genitive that no longer exist in English).

2481,like or as if?,"Using like as a preposition (“ride like the wind”) is uncontroversial. Using it as a conjunction, introducing a clause that contains a verb (“ride like you’re riding a motorbike”, “he behaved like he was drunk”) will annoy many readers.

The simple way to keep everyone happy is to use like when the verb is followed by a noun (“he ran like a gazelle”) and as if when the verb is followed by a clause (“he ran as if he had seen a ghost”). Ogden Nash pointed out that it’s As You Like It, not Like You Like It, although Shakespeare in fact did use like as a conjunction"
2482,like or such as?,"“Cities like Manchester are wonderful” suggests the writer has in mind, say, Sheffield or Birmingham; it’s clearer to say “cities such as Manchester” if that is what she means.

Do not, however, automatically change “like” to “such as” - the following appeared in the paper: “He is not a celebrity, such as Jesse Ventura, the former wrestler ... “"
2483,likely,"In the UK, if not the US, using likely in such contexts as “they will likely win the game” sounds unnatural at best; there is no good reason to use it instead of probably.

2519,London assembly,"elected body of 25 members whose role is to hold the mayor of London to account. Together, assembly and mayor constitute the Greater London authority (GLA); note there is no such organisation as the “Greater London assembly”"
2520,London boroughs and counties,"Parts of the traditional counties of Essex, Middlesex, Kent and Surrey that are close to London retain the county link in their postal address (eg Bromley, Kent), even when they are administratively part of a London borough (eg the London borough of Bromley), and represented in the London assembly. This leads to inconsistencies, as when we refer to “Chingford, Essex” in one story and “Chingford, east London” in another.

It is hard to be totally consistent - the preferences even of people who live in such places may vary (according to how long they have lived there, for example).

In general, use London rather than the traditional counties - Ilford, east London; Bexley, south-east London, etc - unless a group or organisation specifically includes a county designation in its title"

In addition to such clearly offensive and unacceptable expressions as loony, maniac, nutter, psycho and schizo, terms to avoid - because they stereotype and stigmatise - include victim of, suffering from, and afflicted by; “a person with” is clear, accurate and preferable to “a person suffering from”.

Terms such as schizophrenic and psychotic should be used only in a medical context: for example never use schizophrenic to mean “in two minds”. Also, they should only be used as adjectives, not nouns.

Avoid writing “the mentally ill” - say mentally ill people, mental health patients or people with mental health problems

2715,#MeToo,
2716,metres,"should be written out in full, to avoid confusion with million (an obvious exception would be athletics, eg she won the 400m)"
2717,metric system,"We use the metric system for weights and measures; exceptions are the mile and the pint. As understanding of the two systems is a matter of generations, conversions (in brackets) to imperial units should be provided wherever this seems useful, though usually one conversion – the first – will suffice. Imperial units in quoted matter should be retained, and converted to metric [in square brackets] if it doesn’t ruin the flow of the quote.

It is not necessary to convert moderate distances between metres and yards, which are close enough for rough and ready purposes (though it is preferable to use metres), or small domestic quantities: 2 litres of wine, a kilogram of sugar, a couple of pounds of apples, a few inches of string.

Small units should be converted when precision is required: 44mm (1.7in) of rain fell in two hours. But be sensible: don’t convert a metric estimate into a precise imperial figure (round the conversion up or down). Tons and tonnes are close enough for most purposes to do without conversion; use tonnes (except in shipping tonnage).

Body weights and heights should always be converted in brackets: metres to feet and inches, kilograms to stones/pounds. Geographical heights and depths, of people, buildings, monuments, etc, should be converted, metres to feet. In square measurement, land is given in sq metres, hectares and sq km, with sq yards, acres or sq miles in brackets where there is space to provide a conversion. The floor areas of buildings are conventionally expressed in sq metres (or sq ft). Take great care in conversions of square and cubic measures: 2 metres is about 6.5ft, but 2 sq metres is about 21.5 sq ft

How to write units for precise measurements (examples):

10mm 10cm 10 metres (but, eg 400m in athletics) 10 sq metres 10km 10kg 10 tonnes 10 litres 10in 10ft 10 sq ft 10 yards 10 miles 10lbs 10 pints"

2740,"migration, refugees and asylum seekers",
2741,Migrant,"should be a neutral term, but is widely used in a pejorative way that dehumanises people and presents them as a threat. It is not banned, but we should use only when necessary; the alternatives are often preferable."
2742,Migration crisis,"is a better term than “migrant crisis” because it suggests that the crisis is a complex global issue, not something that can be blamed on those doing the migrating. An alternative is refugee crisis .

Where possible, we should use the word people rather than “migrants”. It’s an accurate description, rather than a dehumanising label. Say “100 people drowned” or “2,000 people were rescued”, rather than “100 migrants” or “2,000 migrants”. Of course we need to give as much information as possible about these people – where they come from, where they are trying to get to, and why.

The 1951 refugee convention’s definition of a refugee is a person who “owing to well-founded fear of being persecuted for reasons of race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political opinion, is outside the country of his nationality and is unable or, owing to such fear, is unwilling to avail himself of the protection of that country”. However, it’s neither possible nor desirable to establish that every single person we are calling a refugee meets such criteria. If people are fleeing civil war or violence in Afghanistan, Eritrea, Libya, Syria, Yemen or Sudan, they are refugees."
2743,Asylum seekers,"are people who have left their country of origin and are seeking asylum in another country but whose applications have not concluded. The term is not interchangeable with “refugees” and is best reserved for people we know are seeking asylum in a particular country. Someone who is refused asylum should be referred to as a refused asylum seeker, not a “failed asylum seeker”."
2744,Smuggling or trafficking?,"Generally speaking, people pay smugglers willingly to take them across borders, but are coerced and exploited by traffickers. So most people being driven across Europe at the moment, however shocking their plight, are being smuggled, not trafficked. See entry on “smuggling or trafficking?”

An “ economic migrant ” is how rightwing newspapers and politicians describe someone who immigrates to the UK to do what emigrants from the UK do when they migrate to other countries."
2745,Terms to avoid:,"“genuine refugees”, “illegal asylum seeker”, “bogus asylum seeker”, “failed asylum seeker”."
2746,Migration Watch UK,also sometimes styling itself Migrationwatch (randomly using both spellings in the same document); calls itself “an independent think tank” but is a rightwing anti-immigration pressure group and should be described as such

Where it is thought necessary to explain who someone is, write “Paul Heckingbottom, the Sheffield United manager, said …” or “the Sheffield United manager, Paul Heckingbottom, said”, etc.

In such cases the commas around the name indicate there is only one person in the position, so write “the Labour leader, Keir Starmer, said” (only one person in the job), but “the former Labour leader Neil Kinnock said” (there have been many).

Do not leave out the definite article in such constructions as “style guru David Marsh said ...” It should be “The style guru David Marsh” (if there are other style gurus) or “David Marsh, the style guru, ...” (if you feel only one person merits such a description)"

Bear in mind, however, that young people (those under 23 or under 21 from April 2024) can be paid less than this. From school leaving age they must receive what is officially known as the national minimum wage.

That means the number of people who have come, minus the number of people who have left the UK to move elsewhere. In recent times this has always in reality been net immigration, because the number of people coming in exceeds the number leaving.

The meaning of net migration is widely understood, but for greater clarity you can call it net immigration or net migration to the UK and probably should do at some point in an article where it is discussed"

Numbers from one to nine should also usually be written as figures when they come alongside a unit of measurement, for example 5 miles, 3kg, but use your discretion if a figure would look oddly precise, for example in a phrase such as: “He drank one pint and left.”"
2998,numbskull,
2999,numeracy,"Numbers have always contained power, and many a journalist will tremble at the very sight of them. But most often the only maths we need to make sense of them is simple arithmetic. Far more important are our critical faculties, all too often switched off at the first sniff of a figure.

It’s easy to be hoodwinked by big numbers in particular. But are they really so big? Compared with what? And what is being assumed? A government announcement of an extra £Xm a year will look far less impressive if divided by 60 million (the British population) and/or 52 (weeks in the year). That’s quite apart from the fact that it was probably trumpeted last week already, as part of another, bigger number.

Never invent a big figure when a small one will do. Totting jail sentences together (“the six men were jailed for a total of 87 years”) is meaningless as well as irritating. Similarly, saying that something has an area the size of 150 football pitches, or is “eight times the size of Wales”, is cliched and may not be helpful.

Be wary of using different ways of reporting comparable figures within a story. It is easier for readers to compare 6% and 10% than to compare 6% and one in 10.

Similarly, writing: “The proportion of X who did Y has fallen from 8.64% to 6.3%” is bad form; the respective figures should be 8.6% and 6.3%.

Avoid meaningless or false precision when reporting statistics. Think about whether it is useful to report a percentage of 57.743% or whether you should round it to 57.7% or even 58%. Particularly as many published statistics are estimates with a margin of error.

If you decide to round up or round down, remember: anything halfway or over is rounded up, so 6.5%, for example, would become 7%, while 6.4% would become 6%.

Here is an easy three-point guide to sidestepping common “mythematics” traps:"
3000,1,"Be careful in conversions, don’t muddle metric and imperial, or linear, square and cubic measures. Square miles and miles square are constantly confused: an area 10 miles square is 10 miles by 10 miles, which equals 100 square miles."
3001,2,"Be extremely wary of (or don’t bother) converting changes in temperature; you run the risk of confusing absolute and relative temperatures, eg while a temperature of 2C is about the same as 36F, a temperature change of 2C corresponds to a change of about 4F."
3002,3,"When calculating percentages, beware the “rose by/fell by X%” construction: an increase from 3% to 5% is a 2 percentage point increase or a 2-point increase, not a 2% increase

the Nupes An alliance of leftwing political parties in France. For its full name use the translation New Popular Ecological and Social Union"
3003,Nuremberg,
3004,N-word,"to be spelt out only if essential to a story (for example, when quoting someone accused of using it) and only after discussion with senior editorial staff"
3005,"OAPs, old age pensioners","Do not use: they are pensioners or old people; do not use old or elderly to describe someone under 75 (the editors reserve the right to increase this upper limit, as appropriate)"
3006,obbligato,not obligato
3007,obesity,"the word obese is not banned, but it is preferable to say someone has obesity, or is living with obesity"
3008,Obiang,"Teodoro Obiang Nguema Mbasogo, president of Equatorial Guinea since 1979; Obiang on second mention"

3054,one,"One should find an alternative, preferably you (unless one is making fun of one’s royal family).

If you do use it, the possessive has an apostrophe: “the ones in the window are one’s favourites”"
3055,"one in six, one in 10","Phrases of this sort should be treated as plural. There are good grammatical and logical reasons for this. Compare “more than one in six Japanese is 65 or older … “ with “more than one in six Japanese are 65 or older … “

Grammatically, we are talking not about the noun “one” but the noun phrase “one in six”, signifying a group of people. Logically, the phrase represents a proportion – just like “17%” or “one-sixth”, both of which take plural verbs. “Two out of every seven” and “three out of 10” take plurals too, functioning identically.

“One in six is … “ is also unnecessarily (and possibly misleadingly) specific, implying that of any six people from the group you take, exactly one will be as described. “One in six” means one-sixth on average over the whole group, and a plural verb better reflects this. We wouldn’t say “Only 1% of Republican voters is able to point to Iraq on a map” just because there’s a “one” in there"

3058,ongoing,"Bureaucrats and business people love this jargon word and associated phrases such as “ongoing situation” or “on an ongoing basis”. Even some journalists are oddly fond of it, although the story has yet to be written that cannot be improved by removing it. “The case continues” is preferable to “the trial is ongoing” online"
3059,only,"can be ambiguous if not placed next to the word or phrase modified: “I have only one ambition” is clearer than “I only have one ambition”; however, be sensible: do not change the song title to I Have Eyes for Only You.

3175,peers,"Our style is to refer to peers by the name by which they are most widely known, which in most cases will be the one they had before their peerage. Use this at first mention, a simple title (Lord or Lady) at second mention, and thereafter surname only. Some examples:

Andrew Adonis (first mention), Lord Adonis (second mention), Adonis (thereafter). Paddy Ashdown, Lord Ashdown, Ashdown. Sebastian Coe, Lord Coe, Coe. Norman Foster, Lord Foster, Foster. Tony Hall, Lord Hall, Hall. Greville Janner, Lord Janner, Janner. Jenny Jones, Lady Jones, Jones. Martha Lane Fox, Lady Lane-Fox (note hyphen), Lane Fox. Andrew Lloyd Webber, Lord Lloyd-Webber (note hyphen), Lloyd Webber. Peter Mandelson, Lord Mandelson, Mandelson. David Owen, Lord Owen, Owen. John Prescott, Lord Prescott, Prescott. John Reid, Lord Reid, Reid. Richard Rogers, Lord Rogers, Rogers. Chris Smith, Lord Smith, Smith. Sayeeda Warsi, Lady Warsi, Warsi.

For people who were not widely known before becoming peers, or who are better known by their title, use a simple title at first mention, and thereafter surname only. Examples:

Lord Sewel (first mention), Sewel (thereafter). Lady Stowell, Stowell.

Even if you claim to be on good terms with the peer in question, avoid such constructions as “Lady Helena Kennedy” or “Baroness Shirley Williams”: call them Helena Kennedy QC at first mention, then Lady Kennedy, then Kennedy; Shirley Williams, then Lady Williams, then Williams.

Do not use Baron, Baroness etc unless there is a particular reason to do so – for example, for satirical or ironic purposes (“Baron Mandelson of Foy in the county of Herefordshire and Hartlepool in the county of Durham”).

Where two or more peers share the same name, make it clear which one you are writing about, for example: Lola Young, the former actor, artist and academic (first mention), Lady Young of Hornsey (second mention), thereafter Young. Barbara Young, a former chief executive of the Environment Agency and Care Quality Commission (first mention), Lady Young of Old Scone (second mention), thereafter Young.

Peers in historical pieces should be given their titles only if they had received them at the time, for example Herbert Asquith’s Liberal government and Margaret Thatcher’s Tory government (not Lord Asquith’s, Lady Thatcher’s) – they had not yet been given peerages"

3182,pensioners,"not “old age pensioners” or “OAPs”; older people is preferable to “elderly people” or (even worse) “the elderly”.

While this term is useful in headlines, it should be avoided in text as a description of an individual. As one of our readers notes: “This usage defines older people by their non-participation in the workforce and immediately typifies them as dependents or drains on the public purse. Rupert Murdoch and Michael Caine are never described as ‘pensioners’ because they are perceived as still contributing to the economy, so does the term only apply to the little people?” Reporters should ask what job people used to do and then describe them as a retired banker/powerboat racer or former whatever (including homemaker)"

3184,people-smuggling,with a hyphen. Consider the ambiguity in sentences such as: “The problem of people smuggling between north Africa and Europe has increased.” There is usually no need to hyphenate people smuggler

3186,per cent,% in headlines and copy
3187,percentage rises,"seem to give us a lot of problems: an increase from 3% to 5% is a 2 percentage point increase or a 2-point increase, not a 2% increase; any sentence saying “such and such rose or fell by X%” should be considered and checked carefully"
3188,peremptory,"not open to challenge; perfunctory careless: if you carry out a task in a perfunctory way, you may face peremptory dismissal"

I struck the board and cry’d, ‘No more; I will abroad.’ What, shall I ever sigh and pine? My lines and life are free; free as the rode, Loose as the winde, as large as store.

If you don’t have room to run it line by line, separate the lines with spaces and a slash:

I struck the board and cry’d, ‘No more; / I will abroad.’ / What, shall I ever sigh and pine? / My lines and life are free; free as the rode, / Loose as the winde, as large as store.

3316,POV,abbreviation for point of view
3317,Pov,"term coined by a Guardian journalist to depict laboured attempts to produce synonyms by writers seeking what Fowler called “elegant variation” (and Orwell “inelegant variation”), often descending into cliche or absurdity. Thus Dalí becomes “the moustachioed surrealist” and Ireland “the cockatoo-shaped landmass”. Pov, incidentally, stands for “popular orange vegetable”"

Schoolchildren used to be told (by English teachers unduly influenced by Latin) that it was ungrammatical to end sentences with a preposition, a fallacy satirised by Churchill’s “this is the sort of English up with which I will not put” and HW Fowler’s “What did you bring me that book to be read to out of for?”

Take care after phrases following “to”: the subheading “to we Conservatives, Labour looks as if it’s heading back to the old horrors of the winter of discontent” drew numerous protests from readers pointing out that it should have been “to us Conservatives … “ (The mistake was ours, not the shadow cabinet minister who wrote the piece)"

3343,presently,"What exactly does this mean? I will tell you presently – soon – is the traditional British English usage, whereas in American English it means at present, and is usually redundant (“we are presently third in the table”). To avoid ambiguity, say soon when you mean soon, and don’t say anything when you mean now.

–

soon

There is a similar problem with momentarily, which means for a moment or briefly in British English, and very soon to American (and some British) speakers. Best avoided"

3355,prevaricate,"Can mean speaking or acting with intent to deceive as well as avoiding giving a direct answer or making a firm decision, so take care when accusing someone of doing it. Similar alternatives might include procrastinate (putting something off), equivocate (using ambiguous language to avoid speaking directly) or vacillate (being indecisive)"

3392,prodigal,"means wasteful or extravagant, not a returned wanderer; the confusion arises from the biblical parable of the prodigal son, but he was prodigal because he wasted his inheritance, not because he wandered off.

Thus a prodigal striker is one who misses lots of chances to score goals, not one who has played for lots of clubs (who will also invariably be described as “much-travelled”)"
3393,profession,"Strictly, to enter a profession you need a specific qualification, such as that acquired by a doctor, lawyer, social worker or teacher. As anyone with a mobile, a laptop and a bit of cheek can be a journalist, or at least claim to be one, journalism is not a profession but a trade, craft or racket. Much the same applies to politics"

3397,pro-life,should not be used to mean anti-abortion
3398,prolific,"means abundant or fruitful, so a “prolific striker” scores lots of goals; it is a positive attribute, and phrases such as “one of Britain’s most prolific paedophiles” (which we used) strikes completely the wrong tone"

3401,prone,face down; supine face up
3402,pronouns,"Some people use they/them/their rather than he/she etc. This should be respected at the same time as avoiding creating confusion for the reader.

One option is to mention that the person uses the singular they. For example: ‘Jones, who uses they, said …’. Alternatively, although they and their are sometimes used in the singular in speech, it may be clearer to rewrite or repeat the person’s name if the use of they/them/their is not explained.

3437,pyrrhic,"A pyrrhic victory is not a hollow one, as often assumed, but one achieved at great cost. King Pyrrhus of Epirus defeated the Romans twice, in 280BC and 279BC, but suffered such heavy losses that he said one more such victory would undo him"

3466,quotation marks,"Use double quotes at the start and end of a quoted section, with single quotes for quoted words within that section. Place full points and commas inside the quotes for a complete quoted sentence; otherwise the point comes outside – “Anna said: ‘Your style guide needs updating,’ and I said: ‘I agree.’” but: “Anna said updating the guide was ‘a difficult and time-consuming task’.”

When beginning a quote with a sentence fragment that is followed by a full sentence, punctuate according to the final part of the quote, eg The minister called the allegations “blatant lies. But in a position such as mine, it is only to be expected.”

Use double quotation marks for words that aren’t actually quotations, for example: These are the people who put the “style” in style guide.

Headlines and standfirsts (where absolutely necessary), captions and display quotes all take single quote marks.

For parentheses in direct quotes, which should be employed very sparingly, use square brackets"
3467,quotes,"

From the editor:

If a reader reads something in direct quotation marks in the Guardian he/she is entitled to believe that the reporter can vouch directly for the accuracy of the quote.

Copying quotes out of other newspapers without any form of attribution is simply bad journalism, never mind legally risky. If, where there are no libel issues, you’re going to repeat quotes, then always say where they came from. It won’t be much help in a legal action, but at least the reader can evaluate the reliability of the source. A quote in the Sunday Sport may – who knows – count for less than one from the Wall Street Journal.

If we’re taking quotes from the radio or television it is our general policy to include an attribution. This matters less if it is a pooled interview or news conference that happens to be covered by, say, the BBC or Sky. If the quote comes from an exclusive interview on a radio or TV programme (eg, Today, Channel 4 News or Newsnight) we should always include an attribution.

Some further guidelines:

Take care with direct speech: our readers should be confident that words appearing in quotation marks accurately represent the actual words uttered by the speaker, although ums and ahems can be removed and bad grammar improved. If you aren’t sure of the exact wording, use indirect speech.

Where a lot of material has been left out, start off a new quote with: “He added: ... ”, or signify this with an ellipsis. Take particular care when extracting from printed material, for example a minister’s resignation letter.

Avoid “that” quotes, ie The prosecutors maintained that “this was not a trial about freedom of the internet. Instead, a serious issue has been raised about the rights of the individual.” There is no reason to introduce a complete direct quote of this kind with “that”. It should be The prosecutors maintained: “This was not a trial ... ” etc. ... Colons, rather than commas, should be used to introduce quotes, ie Guardian Style says: “Please use colons, not commas;” not Guardian Style says, “Please use ... ” etc. We are writing a newspaper, not a novel.

Think about where the attribution goes, and avoid this kind of thing: “Gordon Brown is a bully and a liar. I have had numerous complaints about his aggressive behaviour,” said Mrs Pratt.

“The prime minister is completely out of control, and everyone inside No 10 knows it,” added Andrew Rawnsley.

It’s extremely annoying to get to the end of the second par and find out it is a different speaker, because it reads as a continuation of the words of Mrs Pratt.

As a general rule, and particularly with lengthy quotations, it is better to start with the attribution, so the reader does not have to engage in a series of mental double-takes trying to find out who is supposed to be saying what. It should be:

Mrs Pratt said: “Gordon Brown is a bully and a liar. I have had numerous complaints about his aggressive behaviour.”

Andrew Rawnsley added: “The prime minister is completely out of control, and everyone inside No 10 knows it.”

Avoid quoting words when it is unnecessary to do so, like this: Benítez said he was “angry” that Liverpool were being written out of the title race. Yes, maybe, quotation marks if he was “incandescent”, or “spitting with rage” – but it is completely unnecessary to use quotation marks for mundane words and unexceptional quotes. They are even finding their way into headlines, which looks awful.

Similarly: MPs said they had not seen any evidence that Andy Coulson “knew that phone hacking was taking place”. There is no need for the quotation marks, which are splattered like confetti across the paper and website every day but should be used only when it is necessary, in both copy and headlines"
3468,Qur’an,"holy book of Islam (not Koran); regarded as the word of God, having been recited by the prophet Muhammad, so in the eyes of Muslims it is wrong to suggest that the prophet “wrote” the Qur’an"

Say African-Caribbean rather than Afro-Caribbean.

Use the word “immigrant” with great care, not only because it is often incorrectly used to describe people who were born in Britain, but also because it has been used negatively for so many years. If relevant, say people are “children of immigrants”, not “second-generation immigrants”.

3701,sanction,"To sanction (verb) something is to approve it; to impose sanctions (noun) is to stop something you disapprove of. So politicians might sanction (permit) the use of sanctions (forbidding) trade with a country they don’t, for the moment, happen to like very much.

OED definitions of the noun “sanction” involve penalties or coercion, typically to enforce a law or treaty. So you find “sanction-breaker” (quoted from the Guardian in connection with sanctions against Rhodesia in 1968). Rather chillingly, a draft 1993 addition to the dictionary includes a new definition: “sanction: in military intelligence, the permission to kill a particular individual”.

Definitions of “sanction” as a verb include ratify, confirm, permit, authorise and encourage. Hence expressions such as “sanctioned by common sense” and “sanctioned by usage”.

The Department for Work and Pensions, confusingly, says it “sanctions” people to mean it imposes sanctions on or penalises them. We should not use it in this sense"

3741,ScotchTape,"TM; say sticky tape scot-free the scot was a kind of medieval council tax, so you got off “scot-free” if you avoided payment"
3742,Scotland,"The following was written by a Scot who works for the Guardian and lives in London. Letters expressing similar sentiments come from across Britain (and, indeed, from around the world):

We don’t carry much coverage of events in Scotland and to be honest, even as an expat, that suits me fine. But I do care very much that we acknowledge that Scotland is a separate nation and in many ways a separate country. It has different laws, education system (primary, higher and further), local government, national government, sport, school terms, weather, property market and selling system, bank holidays, right to roam, banks and money, churches, etc.

If we really want to be a national newspaper then we need to consider whether our stories apply only to England (and Wales) or Britain, or Scotland only. When we write about teachers’ pay deals, we should point out that we mean teachers in England and Wales; Scottish teachers have separate pay and management structures and union. When we write about it being half-term, we should remember that it’s known as mid-term in Scotland. When we write about bank holiday sunshine/rain, we should remember that in Scotland the weather was probably different and it possibly wasn’t even a bank holiday. When we write about the English cricket team, we should be careful not to refer to it as “we” and “us”. When the Scottish Cup final is played, we should perhaps consider devoting more than a few paragraphs at the foot of a page to Rangers winning their 100th major trophy (if it had been Manchester United we’d have had pages and pages with Bobby Charlton’s all-time fantasy first XI and a dissertation on why English clubs are the best in Europe). Andy Murray is Scottish, as well as British, rather than Scottish when he loses and British when he wins.

These daily oversights come across to a Scot as arrogance. They also undermine confidence in what the paper is telling the reader"

3745,"Scott, Charles Prestwich","(1846-1932) editor of the Manchester Guardian for 57 years and its owner from 1907 until his death (his uncle, John Edward Taylor, had founded the paper in 1821). Scott, who was editor when the first “Style-book of the Manchester Guardian” – forerunner of this guide – appeared in 1928, is most famous for his statement “comment is free, but facts are sacred”.

WP Crozier recalled of Scott: “Once, when an article in type was shown to him because a certain sentence expressed a doubtful judgment, he noticed that the English was slovenly, amended it, and then, being drawn on from sentence to sentence and becoming more and more dissatisfied, he made innumerable minute corrections until at last, having made a complete mess of the proof, he looked up and said gently: ‘Dear X; of course, he’s not a trained subeditor.’”"
3746,Scott Trust,"created in 1936 to safeguard the journalistic freedom and liberal values of the Manchester Guardian.

3760,sea change or step-change?,"used interchangeably, typically to mean nothing more than “a big change”, but there is a difference that you might think worth preserving. Shakespeare coined the former in a well-known passage of The Tempest:

Full fathom five thy father lies; Of his bones are coral made; Those are pearls that were his eyes; Nothing of him that doth fade, But doth suffer a sea change, Into something rich and strange.

Full fathom five thy father lies; Of his bones are coral made; Those are pearls that were his eyes; Nothing of him that doth fade, But doth suffer a sea change, Into something rich and strange.

The idea is that a major transformation is taking place, but very slowly. By contrast, step-change comes from physics, where it means an abrupt change in a value, as in voltage"

3776,section 28,"or clause 28 of the Local Government Act 1988, widely regarded as homophobic, said local authorities “shall not intentionally promote homosexuality or publish material with the intention of promoting homosexuality” or “promote the teaching in any maintained school of the acceptability of homosexuality as a pretended family relationship”; it was repealed in Scotland in 2000 and the rest of the UK in 2003. David Cameron subsequently admitted: “We got it wrong”"
3777,"sections, schedules, subsections","to acts of parliament thus: section 10 (3), schedule 7, etc. An act is divided into numbered sections, which sometimes introduced a schedule placed at the end of the act.

3786,Sellotape,TM; call it sticky tape
3787,semicolon,"Used correctly (which occasionally we do), the semicolon is a very elegant compromise between a full stop (too much) and a comma (not enough). This sentence, from a column by David McKie, illustrates beautifully how it’s done: “Some reporters were brilliant; others were less so.”

The late Beryl Bainbridge said in the Guardian: “Not many people use it much any more, do they? Should it be used more? I think so, yes. A semicolon is a partial pause, a different way of pausing, without using a full stop. I use it all the time” and George Bernard Shaw told TE Lawrence that not using semicolons was “a symptom of mental defectiveness, probably induced by camp life”.

Orwell, on the other hand, thought they were unnecessary and Kurt Vonnegut attacked them as “standing for absolutely nothing”. “Do not use semicolons,” he advised. “All they do is show you’ve been to college.”"
3788,semtex,no longer necessary to cap this

3791,Senedd Cymru,"The Welsh parliament. The devolved government’s representative body, with 60 members – MSs – who were formerly National Assembly for Wales members, or AMs. The Senedd is also the name of the building where they meet. It’s fine to use the Senedd, in the same way we use the Dáil. Take care not to confuse the Senedd (the legislature) with the devolved government (the executive)"
3792,senior,"abbreviate to Sr not Sen or Snr, eg Douglas Fairbanks Sr"
3793,Sentencing Council,issues guidelines on sentencing in England and Wales for the courts to follow. The Scottish equivalent is the Scottish Sentencing Council
3794,September 11,"Use September 11 (ie contrary to our usual date style) when it is being evoked as a particular event, rather than just a date, eg: How September 11 changed the world for ever But “how the events of 11 September 2001 changed the world for ever” would follow our normal date style."
3795,9/11,"may be substituted for either, as necessary, particularly in tight headlines, eg: How 9/11 changed the world for ever

The official death toll of the victims of the Islamist terrorists who hijacked four aircraft on 11 September 2001 is 2,976. The figure does not include the 19 hijackers. Of this total, 2,605 died in the twin towers of the World Trade Centre or on the ground in New York City (of whom approximately 1,600 have been identified), 246 died on the four aeroplanes, and 125 were killed in the attack on the Pentagon.

The hijackers were: Fayez Ahmed, Mohamed Atta, Ahmed al-Ghamdi, Hamza al-Ghamdi, Saeed al-Ghamdi, Hani Hanjour, Nawaf al-Hazmi, Salem al-Hazmi, Ahmed al-Haznawi, Khalid al-Mihdhar, Majed Moqed, Ahmed al-Nami, Abdulaziz al-Omari, Marwan al-Shehhi, Mohannad al-Shehri, Wael al-Shehri, Waleed al-Shehri, Satam al-Suqami, Ziad Jarrah (though dozens of permutations of their names have appeared in the paper, we follow Reuters style as for most Arabic transliterations)"

3804,"services, the",(armed forces)
3805,settler,"should be confined to those Israeli Jews living in settlements across the 1967 green line, ie in the occupied territories. It is best not to use the word “settlement” to describe any Israeli towns, villages and communities that are not in these areas"
3806,set to,"It is very tempting to use this, especially in headlines, when we think something is going to happen, but aren’t all that sure; try to resist this temptation. It is even less excusable when we do know that something is going to happen: one of our readers counted no fewer than 16 uses of the phrase in the paper in two days; in almost every case, the words could have been replaced with “will”, or by simply leaving out the “set”, eg “the packs are set to come into force as part of the house-selling process”.

The first readers’ editor of the Guardian put it like this: “The expression ‘set to’, to mean about to, seems likely to ... is often used to refer to something that, though expected, is not absolutely certain to happen. It is a rascally expression which one of the readers who have learned to groan at the sight of it describes as an all-purpose term removing any precision of meaning from the sentence containing it”"
3807,Seven,"not “Se7en” for the 1995 film starring Morgan Freeman, Brad Pitt and Gwyneth Paltrow"
3808,sexing up,"is what happens in dodgy dossiers and not, we hope, our publications. From the editor:

Guardian readers would rather we did give them the unvarnished truth – or our best stab at it. It seems obvious enough. But inside many journalists – this goes for desk editors as much as reporters – there is a little demon prompting us to make the story as strong and interesting as possible, if not more so. We drop a few excitable adjectives around the place. We overegg. We may even sex it up.

Strong stories are good. So are interesting stories. But straight, accurate stories are even better. Readers who stick with us over any length of time would far rather judge what we write by our own Richter scale of news judgments and values than feel that we’re measuring ourselves against the competition. Every time we flam a story up we disappoint somebody – usually a reader who thought the Guardian was different.

We should be different. Of course we compete fiercely in the most competitive newspaper market in the world. Of course we want to sell as many copies as possible. We’ve all experienced peer pressure to write something as strongly as possible, if not more so. But our Scott Trust ownership relieves us of the necessity to drive remorselessly for circulation to the exclusion of all else. In other words, we don’t need to sex things up, and we shouldn’t"
3809,sex offender register,"abbreviation, normally sufficient, of the Violent and Sex Offender Register (Visor), a database set up by the Sexual Offences Act 2003"
3810,sex worker,"preferable to the term prostitute unless an individual or group use the latter eg the English Collective of Prostitutes.

When reporting on people who work in the sex industry it is Guardian policy that they be identified as individuals first, not by the way they earn money. So for example say police are investigating the murder of three women rather than “three sex workers”.

Be careful how you refer to children working in the industry if you do not know the circumstances around how they came to be there. However, avoid referring to them as child sex workers because, depending on the laws of the relevant country, they are more accurately victims of child sexual exploitation and abuse."
3811,sexual abuse,"unwanted sexual behaviour, or molestation. Do not use “sex abuse” as the term “sex” can imply consent.

The term victim is generally used for those in an abusive situation or at risk of abuse. The term survivor is generally used for people who have experienced sexual abuse in the past. Give priority to the preferences of the person we are writing about.

Avoid using the term “historical” to describe sexual abuse crimes from the past. Survivors, particularly adults who were abused as children, feel the term undermines the long-lasting impact of the crimes. Try to date the crimes (year, decade etc) instead, or say they happened in the past eg “Detectives are investigating allegations of child sexual abuse from more than 30 years ago.” Exceptions may be necessary in court cases where specific wording is required. (See also abuse. )

Always include helpline numbers: In the UK, Rape Crisis offers support for rape and sexual abuse on 0808 802 9999 in England and Wales, 0808 801 0302 in Scotland , or 0800 0246 991 in Northern Ireland .

3812,sexuality,"From a reader:

“Can I suggest your style guide should state that homosexual, gay, bisexual and heterosexual are primarily adjectives and that use of them as nouns should be avoided. It seems to me that this is both grammatically and politically preferable (politically because using them as nouns really does seem to define people by their sexuality). I would like to read that someone is ‘homosexual’, not ‘a homosexual’, or about ‘gay people’, not ‘gays’. Lesbian is different as it is a noun which later began to be used adjectivally, not the other way round. As an example from Wednesday, the opening line ‘Documents which showed that Lord Byron … was a bisexual’ rather than ‘was bisexual’ sounds both Daily Mail-esque and stylistically poor.”"

By planet-infesting humans. They need protection.” The word “infest” is defined as “swarm over, cover or fill in a troublesome, unpleasant or harmful way, to invade and live on as a parasite”.

1 Exploitation: smugglers are paid by people to take them across borders, after which the transaction ends; traffickers bring them into a situation of exploitation and profit from their abuse in the form of forced labour or prostitution.

2 Consent: migrants usually consent to be smuggled; a trafficked person does not (or their “consent” is meaningless because they have been coerced).

3 Borders: smuggling always takes place across international borders; trafficking does not (you can be trafficked, say, from Rochdale to Rotherham)"

3914,snowclone,"A type of cliched phrase defined by the linguist Geoffrey Pullum as “a multi-use, customisable, instantly recognisable, timeworn, quoted or misquoted phrase or sentence that can be used in an entirely open array of different variants”. The name is derived from the cliche about how many words “Eskimos” are mistakenly said to have for snow. Examples of snowclones include “xxx [eg comedy] is the new yyy [eg rock’n’roll]”, “you wait ages for a xxx [eg gold medal] and then yyy [eg three] come along at once”, and so on. Such phrases are very popular with journalists searching for what Pullum calls “quick-fix ways of writing stuff without actually having to think out new descriptive vocabulary or construct new phrases and sentences”"

Since the 2001 census, the main UK social classification has been the National Statistics socioeconomic classification (NS-SEC), grouping occupations by employment conditions and relations rather than skills, and has 17 categories, which can be broken down into eight (from higher managerial and professional occupations to never worked and long-term unemployed), or just three (higher, intermediate and lower occupations)"

3958,Spanish names and accents,"Take care over use of the tilde, which can change the meaning: Los Años Dorados (the Spanish version of the sitcom The Golden Girls) means The Golden Years; leave out the tilde and Los Anos Dorados becomes The Golden Anuses.

The surname is normally the second last name, not the last, which is the mother’s maiden name, eg the writer Federico García Lorca – known as García in Spain rather than Lorca – should be García Lorca on second mention. Note also that the female name Consuelo ends with an “o” not an “a”.

In Spanish the natural stress of a word generally occurs on the second to last syllable. Words that deviate from this norm must carry a written accent mark, known as the acento ortográfico, to indicate where the stress falls. A guide to accents follows. If in doubt do an internet search (try the word with and without an accent) and look for reputable Spanish language sites, eg big newspapers."
3959,Surnames ending -ez,"take an accent over the penultimate vowel, eg Benítez, Fernández, Giménez, Gómez, González, Gutiérrez, Hernández, Jiménez, López, Márquez, Martínez, Núñez, Ordóñez, Pérez, Quiñónez, Ramírez, Rodríguez, Sáez, Vásquez, Vázquez, Velázquez.

3980,spin-off,"noun, spin off verb"
3981,spinster,"avoid this old-fashioned term, which has acquired a pejorative tone; say, if relevant, that someone is an unmarried woman"
3982,"spiral, spiralling",prices (and other things) can spiral down as well as up; try a less cliched word that doesn’t suggest a circular movement
3983,split infinitives,"“The English-speaking world may be divided into (1) those who neither know nor care what a split infinitive is; (2) those who do not know, but care very much; (3) those who know and condemn; (4) those who know and distinguish. Those who neither know nor care are the vast majority, and are happy folk, to be envied.” (HW Fowler, Modern English Usage, 1926)

It is perfectly acceptable, and often desirable, to sensibly split infinitives – “to boldly go” is an elegant and effective phrase – and stubbornly to resist doing so can sound pompous and awkward (“the economic precipice on which they claim perpetually to be poised”) or ambiguous: “He even offered personally to guarantee the loan that the Clintons needed to buy their house” raises the question of whether the offer, or the guarantee, was personal.

Raymond Chandler wrote to his publisher: “Would you convey my compliments to the purist who reads your proofs and tell him or her that I write in a sort of broken-down patois which is something like the way a Swiss waiter talks, and that when I split an infinitive, God damn it, I split it so it will stay split.” And after an editor tinkered with his infinitives, George Bernard Shaw said: “I don’t care if he is made to go quickly, or to quickly go – but go he must!”"
3984,spoiled or spoilt?,"spoiled is the past tense, spoilt is the past participle; she spoiled her son: in fact he was a spoilt brat"
3985,spokesperson,"a quote may be attributed to the organisation, eg “The AA said … ”, but if necessary say spokesperson rather than spokesman or spokeswoman (assuming they have actually spoken to you)"
3986,SpongeBob SquarePants,is his full name; SpongeBob after first mention
3987,sponsorship,"We are under no obligation to carry sponsors’ names. So London Marathon, not Virgin London Marathon, etc. When a competition is named after a sponsor, it is unavoidable: Friends Provident t20, etc"
3988,"spoonful, teaspoonful","plural spoonfuls, teaspoonfuls, not the old-fashioned spoonsful, teaspoonsful"
3989,sprang or sprung?,"sprang is the past tense of spring; sprung is the past participle. When we got this wrong, a reader commented: “The error sprang out at me immediately as it should have sprung out to your subeditor”"
3990,spree,"shopping or spending, not shooting: describing a series of murders as a “killing spree” sounds flippant"
3991,"spring, summer, autumn, winter",
3992,spun,"is the past tense and past participle of spin, despite “when Adam delved and Eve span” (1560), which is an older past tense form"
3993,square brackets,"are used for interpolated words in quotations, eg David Cameron said: “Theresa [May] has my full support.”

They can clutter up a piece and make it difficult to read, as in this example: “I was in awe of the place as a player. You looked at Man United and you saw men. [Eric] Cantona, Giggs, [David] Beckham, [Andrei] Kanchelsis, Bryan Robson, it just went on.” And on, he might have added. The subeditor was trying to help, but you’d have to have spent 10 years on another planet not to know who “Cantona” or “Beckham” are.

Use square brackets sparingly and only when they will help, rather than insult [the intelligence of] the reader"
3994,square metres,"not the same as metres squared: eg 300m squared is 90,000 sq metres which is very different from 300 sq metres; we often get this wrong"

3999,staff,are plural
4000,stalactites,cling from the ceiling; stalagmites grow from the ground
4001,stalemate,"in chess, a stalemate is the end of the game, and cannot be broken or resolved; deadlock or impasse are more suitable for metaphorical use in such cases as “Zawiyah – 30 miles from the capital – is a metaphor for Libya’s current stalemate, which could itself end at any moment”"
4002,"Stalin, Joseph",not Josef
4003,stammer/stutter,"stammer is the more well-used term for the speech condition. Avoid using either term when describing something operating in a stop-start manner and use an alternative instead, eg falter"
4004,stampede,"should be reserved for herds of animals, and not used in tragedies involving crowds of people, for example at the hajj in Mina in 2015. People are crushed to death in high-density crowds and typically die of asphyxiation, not because they are trampled in the way that “stampede” implies. Human “stampedes” are very unusual, and rarely fatal.

The word “stampede” suggests a panicking mass of people who are collectively responsible for trampling others to death, whereas in fact the deaths occur (at a slower speed) as an accidental result of high densities. Those who allow such densities to build up are responsible and as a result, as with Hillsborough, they are often keen to portray the event as a panic or a stampede.

We should follow the experts and use the term “crowd crush” or similar"
4005,standard of proof,"The standard of proof is either criminal (beyond reasonable doubt) or civil (on a balance of probabilities). The burden of proof refers to who has to prove an allegation in court ie in criminal cases the burden of proof is on the prosecution, in libel cases it is the defendant (ie the libeller rather than the libelled)."

4018,staycation,use to refer to people staying in their own home for their holidays and going out on day trips. Its definition has expanded to sometimes include people going on holiday in their own countries but given this is how a significant proportion of any population take their holidays its use in this context can potentially cause confusion and offence.

4040,stone age,"The charity Survival says: “ ‘Stone age’ and ‘primitive’ have been used to describe tribal people since the colonial era, reinforcing the idea that they have not changed over time and that they are backward. This idea is both incorrect and very dangerous: incorrect because all societies adapt and change, and dangerous because it is often used to justify the persecution or forced ‘development’ of tribal people”"

4056,strikes,"we aim to accurately describe strike action in industrial disputes without taking sides. Saying employees are on strike, striking or taking strike action is the most straightforward way. Of the other options, some are more helpful than others."
4057,"Stoppage,","stopped work or stayed off work are fine. Industrial action is a bit vague, and does not necessarily include strikes. Walkout (as a noun) has negative (in the sense of anti-union) connotations. It does evoke sudden or wildcat strikes. Use with care. Walked out as an alternative to stopped work is not quite the same as walkout, and is fine if that actually happened, but context is all: “Thousands of tube workers walked out at 6pm to start a 24-hour strike” is OK. The point is that we are describing what happened without taking sides. Downed tools is too old-fashioned. “Journalists at the Guardian downed tools yesterday” just sounds silly. Avoid, unless actual hammers, screwdrivers etc are involved"

In some countries, eg the US and Canada, they are known as copy editors.

WP Crozier said of CP Scott: “As a subeditor he got rid of the redundant and the turgid with the conscientiousness of a machine that presses the superfluous moisture out of yarn. The man who passed ‘seaward journey to the great metropolis’, and when the copy came back to him found written in firm blue pencil ‘voyage to London’, knew what sort of English ‘CP’ liked”"
4070,subfusc,an adjective meaning dull and gloomy or a noun for the dark clothing worn for exams and formal occasions at some universities
4071,subjunctive,"Fowler noted that the subjunctive was “seldom obligatory” and Somerset Maugham declared half a century ago: “The subjunctive mood is in its death throes, and the best thing to do is put it out of its misery as soon as possible.” Would that that were so.

Most commonly, the subjunctive is a third person singular form of the verb expressing hypothesis, typically something demanded, proposed, imagined: he demanded that she resign at once, I propose that she be sacked, she insisted Jane sit down.

It is particularly common in American English and in formal or poetic contexts: If I were a rich man, etc, and you have to admit the song sounds better than “If I was a rich man ...”

We get this wrong at least as often as we get it right. Two examples from the same issue in April 2010 in which “was” should be “were”: “If every election or ballot in which there are cases of bad practice was to be invalidated, democracy would soon become a laughing stock ...” (leading article); “If this was the centred Conservative party that Cameron claims, its strategists wouldn’t be half as worried as they are ...” (column)

Nobody died and no great harm was done, but as professional writers we should be aware of the distinction. Used properly, the subjunctive can add elegance to your writing; an object lesson was provided in a Gary Younge column of 5 July 2010: “It was as though Charlie Brown’s teacher were standing for leader of the opposition ... “ (one of three examples of the subjunctive in the piece).

As with the hyper-corrective misuse of whom instead of who, however, using the subjunctive wrongly is worse than not using it at all, and will make you look pompous and silly"

4083,suffragist or suffragette?,"these two terms are not interchangeable, so make sure you are using the right one. The suffragettes, associated with Emmeline Pankhurst, advocated achieving the vote for women by any means necessary. Suffragists such as Millicent Fawcett, on the other hand, campaigned using more peaceful methods. Of the two terms suffragist is the one that can be used more generally to signify people through history advocating for the right to vote"
4084,suicide,"Say that someone killed him or herself rather than “committed suicide”; suicide has not been a crime in the UK for many years and this old-fashioned term can cause unnecessary further distress to families who have been bereaved in this way.

Journalists should exercise particular care in reporting suicide or issues involving suicide, bearing in mind the risk of encouraging others. This applies to presentation, including the use of pictures, and to describing the method of suicide. Any substances should be referred to in general rather than specific terms. When appropriate, a helpline number (eg Samaritans) should be given. The feelings of relatives should also be carefully considered.

The following note should be added to stories about suicide:

In the UK and Ireland, Samaritans can be contacted on freephone 116 123, or email jo@samaritans.org or jo@samaritans.ie . In the US, you can call or text the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline on 988, chat on 988lifeline.org , or text HOME to 741741 to connect with a crisis counselor. In Australia, the crisis support service Lifeline is 13 11 14. Other international helplines can be found at befrienders.org

Change the order if necessary to reflect the context and origin of the story; only the Samaritans number need be used in print editions that are not sold outside the UK.

The endnote should not be used on stories about assisted dying.

4116,swearwords,"We are more liberal than any other newspapers, using language that most of our competitors would not. The statistics tell their own story: the word “fuck” (and its variants) appeared 705 times in the Guardian in the 12 months to April 2010, with a further 269 mentions in the Observer. (The figures for other national newspapers were as follows: Independent 279, Independent on Sunday 74, Times 3, Sunday Times 2, all other papers 0.) The figures for the C-word, still regarded by many people as taboo, were: Guardian 49, Observer 20, Independent 8, Independent on Sunday 5, everyone else 0.

Even some readers who agree with Lenny Bruce that “take away the right to say fuck and you take away the right to say fuck the government” might feel that we sometimes use such words unnecessarily, although comments in response to Guardian Style’s blogpost on the subject were overwhelmingly in support of our policy.

The editor’s guidelines are as follows:

First, remember the reader, and respect demands that we should not casually use words that are likely to offend.

Second, use such words only when absolutely necessary to the facts of a piece, or to portray a character in an article; there is almost never a case in which we need to use a swearword outside direct quotes. The use of swearwords in furniture, especially headlines, should also be avoided unless an editor deems it absolutely necessary.

Third, the stronger the swearword, the harder we ought to think about using it.

Finally, never use asterisks, or such silliness as b------, which are just a cop-out, as Charlotte Brontë recognised: “The practice of hinting by single letters those expletives with which profane and violent people are wont to garnish their discourse, strikes me as a proceeding which, however well meant, is weak and futile.

4205,"terrorism, terrorists","A terrorist act is directed against victims chosen either randomly or as symbols of what is being opposed (eg workers in the World Trade Center, tourists in Bali, Spanish commuters). It is designed to create a state of terror in the minds of a particular group of people or the public as a whole for political or social ends. Although most terrorist acts are violent, you can be a terrorist without being overtly violent (eg poisoning a water supply or gassing people on the underground).

Does having a good cause make a difference? The UN says no: “Criminal acts calculated to provoke a state of terror in the general public are in any circumstances unjustifiable, whatever the considerations of a political, philosophical, ideological, racial, ethnic, religious or other nature that may be invoked to justify them.”

Whatever one’s political sympathies, suicide bombers, the 9/11 attackers and most paramilitary groups can all reasonably be regarded as terrorists (or at least groups some of whose members perpetrate terrorist acts).

Nonetheless we need to be very careful about using the term: it is still a subjective judgment – one person’s terrorist may be another person’s freedom fighter, and there are former “terrorists” holding elected office in many parts of the world. Some critics suggest that, for the Guardian, all terrorists are militants – unless their victims are British. Others may point to what they regard as “state terrorism”. Often, alternatives such as militants, radicals, separatists, etc, may be more appropriate and less controversial, but this is a difficult area: references to the “resistance”, for example, imply more sympathy to a cause than calling such fighters “insurgents”. The most important thing is that, in news reporting, we are not seen – because of the language we use – to be taking sides.

Note that the phrase “war on terror” should always appear in quotes, whether used by us or (more likely) quoting someone else"

4212,Thaksin Shinawatra,former prime minister of Thailand; Thaksin on second mention
4213,thalidomide,
4214,that,"Do not use automatically after the word “said”, but it can be useful: you tend to read a sentence such as “he said nothing by way of an explanation would be forthcoming” as “he said nothing by way of an explanation” and then realise that it does not say that at all; “he said that nothing by way of an explanation would be forthcoming” is much clearer. A similar problem arises with verbs such as argue and warn. “He argued the case for war had not been made” and “he warned the case for war had not been made” both become much clearer if you insert “that” after the verb"
4215,that or which?,"The traditional definition is that “that” defines and “which” informs (gives extra information), as in: “This is the house that Jack built; but this house, which John built, is falling down.” “The Guardian, which I read every day, is the paper that I admire above all others.” “I am very proud of the sunflowers that I grew from seed” (some of them); “I am very proud of the sunflowers, which I grew from seed” (all of them). Note that in such examples the sentence remains grammatical without “that” (“this is the house Jack built,” “The Guardian is the paper I admire above all others,” “I am very proud of the sunflowers I grew”) but not without “which” (“this house, John built, is falling down”).

A word about relative clauses: restrictive relative clauses (also known as defining, best thought of as giving essential information by narrowing it down) are not enclosed by commas, whereas non-restrictive relative clauses (non-defining, giving non-essential information) are.

In the three examples, “which John built”, “which I read every day” and “which I grew from seed” are all non-restrictive. They give extra information, they are preceded by a comma, and they use “which” rather than “that”. If you try them with “that” they sound odd (“the Guardian, that I read every day”). It’s not the same the other way round: although “that” is more common in restrictive clauses, you can use “which”: “the Guardian is the paper which I read every day”.

A formula that may help simplify things: Restrictive clauses – “that” (desirable), no comma (essential). Non-restrictive clauses – “which”, comma (both essential). So a BBC radio interviewer who asked the question “should advertising, which targets children, be banned?” was suggesting that all advertising targets children. She meant “should advertising that targets children be banned?”"
4216,the,"Leaving “the” out often reads like official jargon: say the conference agreed to do something, not “conference agreed”; the government has to do, not “government has to”; the Super League (rugby), not “Super League”.

Avoid the “prime minister Rishi Sunak” syndrome: do not use constructions such as “prime minister Rishi Sunak said”. Prominent figures can just be named, with their function at second mention: “Rishi Sunak said last night” (first mention); “the prime minister said” (subsequent mentions).

If it is thought necessary to explain who someone is, write “Chris Wilder, the Sheffield United manager, said” or “the Sheffield United manager, Chris Wilder, said”. In such cases the commas around the name indicate there is only one person in the position, so write “the Tory prime minister, Rishi Sunak, said” (only one person in the job), but “the former Tory prime minister David Cameron said” (there have been many).

lc for newspapers (the Guardian), magazines (the New Statesman), pubs (the Coach and Horses), bands (the Black Eyed Peas, the Not Sensibles, the The), nicknames (the Hulk, the Red Baron), and sports grounds (the Oval).

4577,whereabouts,singular: her whereabouts is not known
4578,which or that?,"This is quite easy, really: “that” defines, “which” gives extra information (often in a clause enclosed by commas):

This is the house that Jack built; but this house, which John built, is falling down. The Guardian, which I read every day, is the paper that I admire above all others. I am very proud of the sunflowers that I grew from seed (some of the sunflowers); I am very proud of the sunflowers, which I grew from seed (all the sunflowers).

4590,who or whom?,"This is how to do it: “When it comes to sci-fi villains, few have endured as well as the Martians, whom HG Wells depicted wielding a weapon called the Heat-Ray in The War of the Worlds, back in 1898.”

And this is how not to do it: “A nation’s weeping turned to tears of joy with the news that Louie – for who media commentators had to commission new words for camp ... – is to star in his own 10-part series.”

Only those with a tin ear for language could be unaware that “who” sounds wrong in the second example, but it is not always so obvious.

If in doubt, ask yourself how the clause beginning who/whom would read in the form of a sentence giving he, him, she, her, they or them instead: if the who/whom person turns into he/she/they, then “who” is right; if it becomes him/her/them, then it should be “whom”.

In this example: “Straw was criticised for attacking Clegg, whom he despised” – “whom” is correct because he despised “him”.

But in “Straw attacked Clegg, who he thought was wrong” – “who” is correct, because it is “he” not “him” who is considered wrong.

Use of “whom” has all but disappeared from spoken English, and seems to be going the same way in most forms of written English too. If you are not sure, it is much better to use “who” when “whom” would traditionally have been required than to use “whom” incorrectly for “who”, something even great writers have been guilty of: “There was a big man whom I think was an hôtelier from Phnom Penh and a French girl I’d never seen before ...” (The Quiet American, Graham Greene – who as a former subeditor should have known better)."

4671,y or ie?,"As a general rule: -y is an English suffix, whose function is to create an adjective (usually from a noun, eg creamy); -ie was originally a Scottish suffix, whose function is to add the meaning of “diminutive” (usually from a noun, eg beastie).

So in most cases, where there is dispute over whether a noun takes a -y or an -ie ending, the correct answer is -ie: she’s a girly girl, but she’s no helpless girlie. Think also scrunchie, beanie, nightie, meanie ... There are exceptions (a hippy, an indie band), but where specific examples are not given, use -ie for nouns and -y for adjectives"

4685,yesterday,"Give some thought to where you place the time element in a story: do not automatically put it at the start (“David Cameron yesterday insisted ...”), a style satirised by the subeditor turned bestselling author Bill Bryson, who wrote: “Anyone not acquainted with journalists could be forgiven for assuming that they must talk something like this: I last night went to bed early because I this morning had to catch an early flight.”

Constructions such as “the two sides were today to consider”, as we have been known to say, sound ugly and artificial. As with headlines, try reading out loud to find the most natural arrangement.

Remember that we have millions of readers in different time zones around the world, for whom yesterday, today and tomorrow will not necessarily mean the same thing. Terms such as yesterday, today, tonight and tomorrow should not be used on the website: if you need to specify, say “on Wednesday”, etc.

“Yesterday” remains appropriate for some newspaper stories, which are most likely to be read in the UK first thing in the morning, but not for the website, which may be read at any time, anywhere in the world"
