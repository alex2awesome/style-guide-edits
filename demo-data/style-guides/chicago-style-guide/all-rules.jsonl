Often it has focused\u2014as it does here\u2014on parts of speech and their syntax. Each part of speech performs a particular function in a sentence or phrase. Traditional grammar has held that there are eight parts of speech: nouns, pronouns, adjectives, verbs, adverbs, prepositions, conjunctions, and interjections.2 Somewhat surprisingly, modern grammarians cannot agree on precisely how many parts of speech there are in English. At least one grammarian says there are as few as three.3 Another insists that there are \u201cabout fifteen,\u201d noting that \u201cthe precise number is still being debated.\u201d4 This section deals with the traditional eight; each part of speech is treated below.

An abstract noun denotes something you cannot physically see, touch, taste, hear, or smell {joy} {expectation} {neurosis}.

The key difference between mass nouns and collective nouns is that unlike collective nouns (which are count nouns), mass nouns almost never take indefinite articles and typically do not have plural forms (a team, but not an evidence; two groups, but not two luggages). A mass noun can stand alone {music is more popular than ever} or with a determiner other than an indefinite article (some music or the music but generally not a music). As the subject of a sentence, a mass noun typically takes a singular verb and pronoun {the litigation is so varied that it defies simple explanation}. Some mass nouns, however, are plural in form but are treated as grammatically singular {politics} {ethics} {physics} {news}. Others are always grammatically plural {manners} {scissors} {clothes}. But just as singular mass nouns don\u2019t take an indefinite article, plural mass nouns don\u2019t combine with numbers: you\u2019d never say three scissors or six manners. Some that refer to concrete objects, such as scissors or sunglasses, can be enumerated by adding pair of {a pair of scissors} {three pairs of sunglasses}. Likewise, singular concrete mass nouns can usually be enumerated by adding a unit noun such as piece (with of) {a piece of cutlery} {seven pieces of stationery}. Both singular and plural mass nouns can take indefinite adjectives such as any, less, much, and some that express general quantity {what you need is some courage} {he doesn\u2019t have any manners}."}

While those examples all use nouns in apposition to pronouns, that\u2019s not closely relevant to the question whether the nouns themselves have the property of person in any grammatical sense. But using that property in analyzing nouns does help to point out three things. First, as with grammatical case, one argument for the property of person is to keep the properties of nouns parallel to those of pronouns, even though English nouns do not change form at all in first, second, or third person as personal pronouns do. Second, person determines what form other words will take\u2014here, the verbs. Third, the examples illustrate why attributing person to nouns requires a stretch of logic\u2014if the pronouns were not present in the first two examples, the verb would be in the third person, even if Dan Walls were talking about himself and even if the speaker were addressing the professor."}

But sometimes the use of the noun instead of the adjective may alter the meaning\u2014e.g., a study group is not necessarily a studious group. A preposition may be needed to indicate a noun\u2019s relationship to other sentence elements.

While this usage is accepted in those spheres, it is only lately showing signs of gaining acceptance in formal writing (see 5.256), where Chicago recommends avoiding its use (see 5.255).5 When referring specifically to a person who does not identify with a gender-specific pronoun, however, they and its forms are often preferred. (They used in this sense was the American Dialect Society\u2019s Word of the Year for 2015.) Like singular you, singular they takes a plural verb. So when the context requires it, they\/them\/their\/theirs, like you\/your\/yours (long used as both singular and plural forms), can be used to refer to one person {they have a degree in molecular biology} {their favorite color is blue}. And themself (like yourself) may be used to signal the singular antecedent (though some people will prefer themselves) {they blamed themself [or themselves]}. A number of other gender-neutral singular pronouns are in use, invented for that purpose; forms of these are usually singular and take singular verbs. In general, a person\u2019s stated preference for a specific pronoun should be respected. See also 5.251\u201360.\n\n\n5. The generic singular they was endorsed in 2015 by the editors of the Washington Post, though with a caveat to first try avoiding it if possible.

Each form has a corresponding absolute possessive pronoun (also called an independent possessive) that can stand alone without a noun: mine, ours, yours, his, hers, its, and theirs. The independent form does not require an explicit object: the thing possessed may be either an antecedent or something understood {this dictionary is mine} {this cabin of yours is nice} {where is hers?}. An independent possessive pronoun can also stand alone and be treated as a noun: it can be the subject or object of a verb {hers is on the table} {pass me yours}, or the object of a preposition {put your coat with theirs}.

Compare the intensive pronoun in I burned the papers myself (in which the object of burned is papers) with the reflexive pronoun in I burned myself (in which the object of burned is myself). Reflexive pronouns serve as objects that usually look back to the subject of a sentence or clause {the cat scared itself} {Gayla took it on herself to make the first move} {Ayoka dressed herself today} {don\u2019t repeat yourself [the subject of this imperative sentence is understood to be you]}. Intensive pronouns repeat the antecedent noun or pronoun to add emphasis {I myself don\u2019t care} {did you speak with the manager herself?} {Kate herself has won several writing awards} {did you knit that yourself?}. An intensive pronoun is used in apposition to its referent, so it\u2019s in the nominative case. A common problem occurs when the -self form does not serve either of those functions. For example, the first-person pronoun in a compound might be used as a subject:\n\n\nPoor: The staff and myself thank you for your contribution.\n\nBetter: The staff and I thank you for your contribution.\n\nOr it might be used as an object that does not refer to the subject:\n\n\nPoor: Deliver the equipment to my partner or myself.\n\nBetter: Deliver the equipment to my partner or me."}

This and these point to objects that are near in space, time, or thought, while that and those point to objects that are somewhat remote in space, time, or thought.

Whom and whomever are the objective forms, used as the object of a verb {you called whom?} or of a preposition {to whom are you referring?}. Three problems arise with determining the correct case. First, because the words are so often found in the inverted syntax of an interrogative sentence, their true function in the sentence can be hard to see without sorting the words into standard subject\u2013verb\u2013object syntax. In the following example, sorting the incorrect \u201cI should say whom is calling\u201d makes the case easier to determine:\n\n\nPoor: Whom should I say is calling?\n\nBetter: Who should I say is calling?\n\nSecond, determining the proper case can be confusing when the pronoun serves a function (say, nominative) in a clause that itself serves a different function (say, objective) in the main sentence. The pronoun\u2019s function in its clause determines its case.\n\n\nPoor: I\u2019ll talk to whomever will listen.\n\nBetter: I\u2019ll talk to whoever will listen.\n\nPoor: Whoever you choose will suit me.\n\nBetter: Whomever you choose will suit me.\n\nIn the first example, the entire clause whoever will listen is the object of the preposition to. But in the clause itself, whoever serves as the subject, and that function determines its case. Similarly, in the second example whomever is the object of choose in the clause, so it technically ought to be in the objective case even though the clause itself serves as the subject of the sentence. Third, as the second example above shows, a further distraction can arise when the who-clause itself contains a nested clause, typically of attribution or identification (here, you choose)."}

The most common examples are another, any, both, each, either, neither, none, one, other, some, and such. There are also compound indefinite pronouns such as anybody, anyone, anything, everybody, everyone, everything, nobody, no one, oneself, somebody, and someone. Each, either, and neither are also called distributive pronouns because they separate the objects referred to from others referred to nearby. Indefinite pronouns have number. When an indefinite pronoun is the subject of a verb, it is usually singular {everyone is enjoying the dinner} {everybody takes notes during the first week}. But sometimes an indefinite pronoun carries a plural sense in informal prose {nobody could describe the music; they hadn\u2019t been listening to it} {everyone understood the risk, but they were lured by promises of big returns}. The forms of indefinite pronouns are not affected by gender or person, and the nominative and objective forms are the same. To form the possessive, the indefinite pronoun may take -\u2019s {that is no one\u2019s fault} {is this anyone\u2019s jacket?} or the adverb else plus -\u2019s {don\u2019t interfere with anybody else\u2019s business} {no one else\u2019s cups were broken}."}

An adjective tells you what sort, how many, how large or small, whose, etc. It may modify an understood as well as an expressed noun {he is a good as well as a wise man [man is understood after good]}. An adjective may add a new idea to a noun or pronoun by describing it more definitely or fully {red wagon} {human error}. Or it may be limiting {three pigs} {this time}. Most adjectives derive from nouns, as plentiful derives from plenty or as stylish derives from style; some derive from verbs, roots, or other adjectives. Often a suffix creates the adjective. Among the suffixes that often distinguish adjectives are -able {manageable}, -al {mystical}, -ary {elementary}, -ed {hammered}, -en {wooden}, -esque {statuesque}, -ful {harmful}, -ible {inaccessible}, -ic {artistic}, -ish {foolish}, -ive {demonstrative}, -less {helpless}, -like {childlike}, -ly {ghostly}, -ous {perilous}, -some {lonesome}, and -y {sunny}.

Some past-participial forms have only this adjectival function, the past-participial verb having taken a different form {a shaven face} {a graven image}. A past participle functioning as an adjective may itself be modified with an adverb such as quite {a quite fatigued traveler}, barely {a barely concealed wince}, little {a little-known fact}, or an adverbial phrase such as very much {a very much distrusted public official}. If the past participle has gained a strong adjectival quality, very will do the job alone without the quantitative much {very tired} {very drunk}.

A phrasal adjective follows these basic rules: (1)\u00a0Generally, if placed before a noun, the phrase should be hyphenated to avoid misdirecting the reader {dog-eat-dog competition}. There may be a considerable difference between the hyphenated and the unhyphenated forms: compare small animal hospital with small-animal hospital. (2)\u00a0If a compound noun is an element of a phrasal adjective, the entire compound noun must be hyphenated to clarify the relationship among the words {time-clock-punching employees}. (3)\u00a0If more than one phrasal adjective modifies a single noun, hyphenation becomes especially important {nineteenth-century song-and-dance numbers} {state-inspected assisted-living facility}. (4)\u00a0If two phrasal adjectives end in a common element, the ending element should appear only with the second phrase, and a suspended hyphen should follow the unattached words to show that they are related to the ending element {middle- and upper-class operagoers}. (5)\u00a0If the phrasal adjective denotes an amount or a duration, the plural should be dropped. For instance, pregnancy lasts nine months but is a nine-month pregnancy, and a shop open 24 hours a day has a 24-hour-a-day schedule. The plural is retained only for fractions {a two-thirds majority}. (6)\u00a0If a phrasal adjective becomes awkward, the sentence should probably be recast. For example, The news about the lower-than-expected third-quarter earnings disappointed investors could become The news about the third-quarter earnings, which were lower than expected, disappointed investors. Or perhaps this: Investors were disappointed by the third-quarter earnings, which were lower than expected. See also 7.81\u201389."}

A transitive verb requires an object to express a complete thought; the verb indicates what action the subject exerts on the object. For example, the cyclist hit a curb states what the subject cyclist did to the object curb. (A few transitive verbs have what are called cognate objects, which are closely related etymologically to the verb {drink a drink} {build a building} {see the sights}.) An intransitive verb does not require an object to express a complete thought {the rescuer jumped}, although it may be followed by a prepositional phrase serving an adverbial function {the rescuer jumped to the ground}. Many verbs may be either transitive or intransitive, the different usages often distinguishing their meanings. For example, when used transitively, as in the king\u2019s heir will succeed him, the verb succeed means \u201cto follow and take the place of\u201d; when used intransitively, as in the chemist will succeed in identifying the toxin, it means \u201cto accomplish a task.\u201d With some verbs, no such distinction is possible. For example, in I will walk; you ride, the verb ride is intransitive. In I will walk; you ride your bike, the verb ride is transitive, but its meaning is unchanged. A verb that is normally used transitively may sometimes be used intransitively to emphasize the verb and leave the object undefined or unknown {the patient eats poorly [how well the patient eats is more important than what the patient eats]}. The test for whether a given verb is transitive is to try it with various possible objects. For each sentence in which an object is plausible, the verb is being used transitively. If an object doesn\u2019t work idiomatically, the verb is being used intransitively."}

For example, with the noun door and the verb open, one can say I opened the door (transitive) or the door opened (intransitive). Many verbs can undergo ergative shifts {the torpedo sank the boat} {the boat sank}. For example, the verb ship was once exclusively transitive {the company shipped the books on January 16}, but in commercial usage it is now often intransitive {the books shipped on January 16}. Likewise, grow (generally an intransitive verb) was transitive only in horticultural contexts {the family grew several types of crops}, but commercial usage now makes it transitive in many other contexts {how to grow your business}.

If the verb ends in -e, only a -d is appended {charge\u2013charged\u2013charged}. (Sometimes a final consonant is doubled.) These verbs are classified as regular, or weak (the latter is a term used in philology to classify forms of conjugation). But a few common verbs have maintained forms derived mostly from Old English roots {begin\u2013began\u2013begun} {bet\u2013bet\u2013bet} {bind\u2013bound\u2013bound} {bite\u2013bit\u2013bitten}. These verbs are called irregular, or strong. The various inflections of strong verbs defy simple classifications, but many past-tense and past-participial forms (1)\u00a0change the vowel in the base verb (as begin), (2)\u00a0keep the same form as the base verb (as bet), (3)\u00a0share an irregular form (as bind), or (4)\u00a0change endings (as bite). (The vowel change between cognate forms in category 1 is called an ablaut.) The verb be is highly irregular, with eight forms (is, are, was, were, been, being, be, and am). Because no system of useful classification is possible for irregular verbs, a reliable memory and a general dictionary are essential tools for using the correct forms consistently. Further complicating the spelling of irregular verbs is the fact that the form may vary according to the sense of the word. When used to mean \u201cto offer a price,\u201d for example, bid keeps the same form in the past tense and past participle, but when it means \u201cto offer a greeting,\u201d it forms bade (traditionally rhyming with glad) and bidden. The form may also depend on whether the verb is being used literally {wove a rug} or figuratively {weaved in traffic}. Finally, a few verbs that are considered regular have an alternative past tense and past participle that is formed by adding -t to the simple verb form {dream\u2013dreamed} {dream\u2013dreamt}. When these alternatives are available, American English tends to prefer the forms ending in -ed (e.g., dreamed, learned, spelled), while British English often prefers the forms ending in -t (dreamt, learnt, spelt)."}

The linking verb itself does not take an object, because it expresses a state of being instead of an action {Mr. Block is the chief executive officer} {that snake is venomous} {his heart\u2019s desire is to see his sister again}. There are two kinds of linking verbs: be-verbs and intransitive verbs that are used in a weakened sense, such as appear, become, feel, look, seem, smell, and taste. The weakened intransitive verbs often have a figurative sense akin to that of become, as in He fell heir to a large fortune (he didn\u2019t physically fall on or into anything) or The river ran dry (a waterless river doesn\u2019t run\u2014it has dried up). (See also 5.170.) Some verbs only occasionally function as linking verbs\u2014among them act {act weird}, get {get fat}, go {go bald}, grow {grow weary}, lie {lie fallow}, prove {prove untenable}, remain {remain quiet}, sit {sit still}, stay {stay trim}, turn {turn gray}, and wax {wax eloquent}. Also, some passive-voice constructions contain linking verbs {this band was judged best in the contest} {she was made sales-force manager}. If a verb doesn\u2019t have a subjective complement, then it doesn\u2019t qualify as a linking verb in that particular construction. For instance, when a be-verb conveys the sense \u201cto be situated\u201d or \u201cto exist,\u201d it is not a linking verb {Kansas City, Kansas, is across the river} {there is an unfilled receptionist position}. Likewise, if a verb such as appear, feel, smell, sound, or taste is followed by an adverbial modifier instead of a subjective complement {he appeared in court} or a direct object {the dog smelled the scent}, it isn\u2019t a linking verb."}

The idea that verb phrases should not be \u201csplit\u201d in this way is quite mistaken (see 5.171). A verb phrase is negated when the negative adverb not is placed after the first auxiliary {we have not called him}. In an interrogative sentence, the first auxiliary begins the sentence and is followed by the subject {must I repeat that?} {do you want more?}. An interrogative can be negated by placement of not after the subject {do you not want more?}, but a contraction is often more natural {don\u2019t you want more?}.

If used thoughtfully, contractions in prose sound natural and relaxed and make reading more enjoyable. Be-verbs and most of the auxiliary verbs are contracted when followed by not: are not\u2013aren\u2019t, was not\u2013wasn\u2019t, cannot\u2013can\u2019t, could not\u2013couldn\u2019t, do not\u2013don\u2019t, and so on. A few, such as ought not\u2013oughtn\u2019t, look or sound awkward and are best avoided. Pronouns can be contracted with auxiliaries, with forms of have, and with some be-verbs. Think before using one of the less common contractions, which often don\u2019t work well in prose, except perhaps in dialogue or quotations. Some examples are I\u2019d\u2019ve (I would have), she\u2019d\u2019ve (she would have), it\u2019d (it would), should\u2019ve (should have), there\u2019re (there are), who\u2019re (who are), and would\u2019ve (would have). Also, some contracted forms can have more than one meaning. For instance, there\u2019s may be there is or there has, and I\u2019d may be I had or I would. The particular meaning may not always be clear from the context."}

A participle that has no syntactic relationship with the nearest subject is called a dangling participle or just a dangler. In effect, the participle ceases to function as a modifier and functions as a kind of preposition. Often the sentence is illogical, ambiguous, or even incoherent, as in Frequently used in early America, experts suggest that shaming is an effective punishment (used does not modify the closest noun, experts; it modifies shaming), or Being a thoughtful mother, I believe Meg gives her children good advice (the writer at first seems to be attesting to his or her own thoughtfulness rather than Meg\u2019s). Recasting the sentence so that the misplaced modifier is associated with the correct noun is the only effective cure {experts suggest that shaming, often used in early America, is an effective punishment}. But rewording to avoid the participle or gerund may be preferable {I believe that because Meg is a thoughtful mother, she gives her children good advice}. Using passive voice in an independent clause can also produce a dangler. In Finding that the questions were not ambiguous, the exam grades were not changed, the participle finding \u201cdangles\u201d because there is no logical subject to do the finding. The sentence can be corrected by using active voice instead of passive, so that the participle precedes the noun it modifies {finding that the questions were not ambiguous, the teacher did not change the exam grades}. Quite often writers will use it or there as the subject of the independent clause after a participial phrase, thereby producing a dangler without a logical subject, as in Reviewing the suggestions, it is clear that no consensus exists. (A possible revision: Our review of the suggestions shows that no consensus exists.) Compare 5.116. See also 5.175."}

The example above could be revised as After Gero finished the research, the screenplay was easy to write, or After finishing the research, Gero found the screenplay easy to write. Dangling gerunds can result in improbable statements. Consider While driving to San Antonio, my phone ran out of power.

Only transitive verbs are said to have voice. The clause the judge levied a $50 fine is in the active voice because the subject judge is acting. But the tree\u2019s branch was broken by the storm is in the passive voice because the subject branch does not break itself\u2014it is acted on by the prepositional object storm. The passive voice is always formed by joining an inflected form of to be (or, in colloquial usage, get) with the verb\u2019s past participle. Compare the ox pulls the cart (active voice) with the cart is pulled by the ox (passive voice). As a matter of style, passive voice {the matter will be given careful consideration} is typically, though not always, inferior to active voice {we will consider the matter carefully}. The choice between active and passive voice may depend on which point of view is desired. For instance, the mouse was caught by the cat describes the mouse\u2019s experience, whereas the cat caught the mouse describes the cat\u2019s. What is important is to be able to identify passive voice reliably. Remember that the mere presence of a be-verb does not necessarily signal passive voice.

First, writers sometimes use an indicative verb form when the subjunctive form is needed:\n\n\nPoor: If it wasn\u2019t for your help, I never would have found the place.\n\nBetter: If it weren\u2019t for your help, I never would have found the place.\n\nSecond, indicative-mood sentences sometimes resemble these subjunctive constructions but aren\u2019t statements contrary to fact:\n\n\nPoor: I called to see whether she were in.\n\nBetter: I called to see whether she was in.\n\nThird, one often sees If I would have gone, I would\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0, with two conditionals, instead of If I had gone, I would\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0.

There has never been a rule against placing an adverbial modifier between the auxiliary verb and the principal verb in a verb phrase. In fact, it\u2019s typically preferable to put the adverb there {the heckler was abruptly expelled} {the bus had been seriously damaged in the crash}. Sometimes it is perfectly appropriate to split an infinitive with an adverb to add emphasis, clarify meaning, or produce a natural sound. (See 5.108.) A verb\u2019s infinitive or to form is split when an intervening word immediately follows to {to bravely assert}. If the adverb bears the emphasis in a phrase {to boldly go} {to strongly favor}, the split infinitive is justified and often even necessary. But if moving the adverb to the end of the phrase doesn\u2019t suggest a different meaning or impair the sound, then you have an acceptable way to avoid splitting the infinitive. Recasting a sentence just to eliminate a split infinitive or to avoid splitting the infinitive can alter the nuance or meaning of the sentence. For example, it\u2019s best to always get up early (always modifies get up) is not quite the same as it\u2019s always best to get up early (always modifies best).

It also frequently, but not always, follows the relative pronouns which {which alternative is your decision based on?} {this is the alternative on which my decision is based} and whom {there is a banker (whom) I must speak with} {I can\u2019t tell you to whom you should apply}.

Compare I bought only tomatoes at the market (I bought nothing else) with I bought tomatoes only at the market (I bought nothing other than tomatoes or I didn\u2019t buy tomatoes from any other place?). In idiomatic spoken English, only is placed before the verb, regardless of what it modifies: I only bought tomatoes at the market.

In fact, a substantial percentage (often as many as 10 percent) of the sentences in first-rate writing begin with conjunctions. It has been so for centuries, and even the most conservative grammarians have followed this practice. Charles Allen Lloyd\u2019s words from 1938 fairly sum up the situation as it stands even today:\nNext to the groundless notion that it is incorrect to end an English sentence with a preposition, perhaps the most widespread of the many false beliefs about the use of our language is the equally groundless notion that it is incorrect to begin one with \u201cbut\u201d or \u201cand.\u201d As in the case of the superstition about the prepositional ending, no textbook supports it, but apparently about half of our teachers of English go out of their way to handicap their pupils by inculcating it. One cannot help wondering whether those who teach such a monstrous doctrine ever read any English themselves.7\n\nStill, but as an adversative conjunction can occasionally be unclear at the beginning of a sentence. Evaluate the contrasting force of the but in question, and see whether the needed word is really and; if and can be substituted, then but is almost certainly the wrong word. Consider this example: He went to school this morning. But he left his lunch box on the kitchen table. Between those sentences is an elliptical idea, since the two actions are in no way contradictory. What is implied is something like this: He went to school, intending to have lunch there, but he left his lunch behind. Because and would have made sense in the passage as originally stated, but is not the right word\u2014the idea for the contrastive but should be explicit. To sum up, then, but is a perfectly proper way to open a sentence, but only if the idea it introduces truly contrasts with what precedes. For that matter, but is often an effective way of introducing a paragraph that develops an idea contrary to the one preceding it.\n\n\n7.

(A synthetic language, such as Latin, depends largely on inflectional forms of words.) In the transition from Old English (AD 450\u20131100) to Middle English (1100\u20131500), the language lost most of its inflected forms\u2014except those for pronouns (I\u2013me\u2013mine etc.). Nouns no longer have nominative and accusative cases. Instead, word order governs meaning. Consider this example: Michael likes crystal. Michael is the subject, likes the verb, and crystal the object. It\u2019s the basic subject\u2013verb\u2013object (SVO) pattern. We deduce the meaning from the position of the words: Michael is an admirer and perhaps a collector of fine glass. If we change it to Crystal likes Michael, the meaning is transformed because of the SVO order. We now infer that someone named Crystal thinks fondly about someone named Michael. The SVO pattern is highly significant: it governs the meaning of most English statements. Departures from it typically signal either unusual emphasis or the posing of a question (as opposed to the making of a statement)."}

An independent clause can stand alone as a sentence {Jos\u00e9 saw a squirrel}, while a dependent clause cannot stand alone because of the presence of a word by which it would normally be linked to an independent clause {because he was hungry, he sat down for a meal}. A dependent clause is usually introduced either by a relative pronoun (making it a relative clause) or by a subordinating conjunction, which establishes the semantic relationship between the independent clause and the dependent one. Combining related ideas by linking one or more dependent clauses to an independent one is called subordination, and the result is a complex sentence. Because a dependent clause is always subordinate to an independent clause for contextual meaning, it is also called a subordinate clause. A dependent clause commonly serves one of several functions: the direct object of a verb {everyone believed that the note was genuine [the that-clause is the direct object of believed]}; an adjectival clause modifying a noun element {he who hesitates is lost [who hesitates adjectivally modifies he]}; an adverbial clause modifying a verb or verb phrase {I bought the car despite my father\u2019s warning not to [the despite-clause modifies the verb bought]}."}

Sometimes, however, the clause may express an indirect condition {if I recall correctly, his assistant\u2019s name is Miljana}, alternative conditions {the party will be a success whether or not it rains}, or an open range of possibilities {whatever you\u2019re doing, it\u2019s working}. Most often, though, a conditional clause expresses a direct condition, which may be open (real or factual) or hypothetical (closed or unreal). An open condition leaves unanswered the question whether the condition will be fulfilled {if you don\u2019t finish the work on time, we\u2019ll have to reevaluate our arrangement}. A hypothetical condition, on the other hand, assumes that the condition has not been, is not, or is unlikely to be fulfilled {if he had only remembered to wear a raincoat, he wouldn\u2019t have ruined his new suit} {if I had a hammer, I could fix this creaky stair} {the transition would be much harder if she left without giving notice}."}

Used with ordinary verbs and with auxiliary verbs, not typically negates a verb, an object, a phrase, or a clause. Not typically precedes whatever sentence element is being negated.

The subject is normally elided from the participial phrase. Not doesn\u2019t have to negate everything that follows it. It may be limited to the element immediately following {I discovered not a scientific breakthrough but a monstrous development}. A sentence containing not may be qualified by another element that limits the extent of the negation. The word\u2019s or clause\u2019s placement may significantly alter the scope of negation. For example:\n\nHe definitely did not accept the job offer.\n[It is final: he rejected the job offer.]\nHe did not definitely accept the job offer.\n[It is uncertain: he might still reject the offer.]\nWe have not eaten yet.\n[We have not eaten, but we expect to eat at some time.]\n\n\nNot can be contracted to -n\u2019t and appended to most auxiliary verbs without changing the form of the verb (e.g., are not \u2192 aren\u2019t, would not \u2192 wouldn\u2019t, has not \u2192 hasn\u2019t).

The two most common expletives are it {it is true!} and there {there must be an answer}. An expletive it or there may be in the subject position, especially when the subject of a sentence is a clause {it is a rule that children must raise their hands to speak during class [the rule is that children must raise their hands to speak during class]} {it is better to stay here than to go there [to stay here is better than to go there]}. In this position, the expletive shifts the emphasis to the predicate containing the true subject. The sentence implies a \u201cwho\u201d or \u201cwhat\u201d question that is answered by the subject. For example, It is foolish to ignore facts tells the reader \u201cwhat\u201d it is foolish to ignore and emphasizes \u201cfacts.\u201d An expletive it may also take the position of a direct object, especially when the real object is a clause or noun phrase {some people don\u2019t like it that stores are open for business on Thanksgiving [some people don\u2019t like stores being open for business on Thanksgiving]}. Using an expletive in this way can tighten a verb phrase and emphasize the object. Compare it was taken for granted that our team would win with we took for granted that our team would win."}

Usually readers have no difficulty intuitively understanding whether they\u2019re encountering a pronoun it or an expletive it. But when the expletive and the pronoun appear close together, they may cause the reader to stumble {The much-anticipated feast was a disappointment; it was poorly cooked and presented. It is hard to believe that such a famous chef thought it would be edible, let alone delight gourmands.}. Avoid having several its in a passage clash in this way.

Every element of a parallel series must be a functional match (word, phrase, clause, sentence) and serve the same grammatical function in the sentence (e.g., noun, verb, adjective, adverb). This syntactic linking of matching elements is called coordination. When linked items do not match, the syntax of the uncoordinated sentence breaks down:\n\n\nPoor: She did volunteer work in the community kitchen, the homeless shelter, and taught free ESL classes offered by her church.\n\nBetter: She did volunteer work in the community kitchen, the homeless shelter, and her church, where she taught free ESL classes.\n\nPoor: The candidate is a former county judge, state senator, and served two terms as attorney general.\n\nBetter: The candidate is a former county judge, state senator, and two-term attorney general.\n\nIn the second example, for instance, the subject, verb, and modifier (the candidate is a former) fit with the noun phrases county judge and state senator, but the third item in the series renders nonsense: The candidate is a former served two terms as attorney general.

Most often the sentence begins with an expletive it and a be-verb (the it-clause). The subject clause emphasizes new information that identifies a person, a place, a time, an object, a cause, etc. For example:\n\nIt was Manuel who met Adam in college. (The focus is on the actor.)\nIt was Adam whom Manuel met in college. (The focus is on the person that the actor met.)\nIt was in college that Manuel met Adam. (The focus is on the time or place when they met.)\n\nThe part of a cleft sentence beginning with the relative pronoun usually refers to information already given.

But one must use care and judgment in consulting any dictionary. The mere presence of a word in the dictionary\u2019s pages does not mean that the word is in all respects fit for print as Standard Written English. The dictionary merely describes how speakers of English have used the language; despite occasional usage notes, lexicographers generally disclaim any intent to guide writers and editors on the thorny points of English usage\u2014apart from collecting evidence of what others do. So infer is recorded as meaning, in one of its senses, imply; irregardless as meaning regardless; restauranteur as meaning restaurateur; and on and on. That is why, in the publishing world, it is generally necessary to consult a style or usage guide, such as Fowler\u2019s Modern English Usage or my own Garner\u2019s Modern English Usage.\n\na; an. Use the indefinite article a before any word beginning with a consonant sound {a euphonious phrase} {a utopian dream}. Use an before any word beginning with a vowel sound {an officer} {an honorary degree}. The word historical and its variations cause missteps, but if the h in these words is pronounced, it takes an a {an hour-long talk at a historical society}. Likewise, an initialism (whose letters are sounded out) may be paired with one article, while an acronym (which is pronounced as a word) beginning with the same letter is paired with the other {an HTML website for a HUD program}.\n\nability; capability; capacity. Ability refers to a person\u2019s physical or mental power or skill to do something {the ability to ride a bicycle}. Capability refers more generally to power or ability to do something challenging {she has the capability to play soccer professionally} or to the quality of being able to use or be used in a certain way {a jet with long-distance-flight capability}. Capacity refers especially to a vessel\u2019s ability to hold or contain something {a high-capacity fuel tank}. Used figuratively, capacity refers especially to a person\u2019s physical or mental power to learn {an astounding capacity for mathematics}. It can also be used as a synonym for ability {capacity for love}, as a formal word for someone\u2019s job, position, or role {in an advisory capacity}, as a word denoting an amount that can be produced or dealt with {full capacity}, or as a means of denoting size or power {engine capacity}.\n\nabjure; adjure. To abjure is to deny or renounce publicly, especially under oath {the defendant abjured the charge of murder} or to declare one\u2019s permanent abandonment of a place {abjure the realm}. To adjure is to charge someone to do something as if under oath {I adjure you to keep this secret} or to try earnestly to persuade {the executive committee adjured all the members to approve the plan}. Some writers misuse adjure for either abhor (= to detest) or require (= to mandate).\n\nabout; approximately. When idiomatically possible, use the adverb about instead of approximately. In the sciences, however, approximately is preferred {approximately 32 coding-sequence differences were identified}. Avoid coupling either word with another word of approximation, such as guess or estimate.\n\nabstruse. See obtuse.\n\naccept; except. To accept something is to receive it {accept this gift} or regard it as proper {accept the idea}. To except something is to exclude it or leave it out {club members will be excepted from the admission charge}, and to except to something is to object to it.\n\naccess, vb. The use of nouns as verbs has long been one of the most common ways that word-usage changes happen in English. Today, few people quibble with using contact, debut, or host, for example, as a verb. Access can be safely used as a verb when referring to computing {access a computer} {access the internet} {access a database}. Outside the digital world, though, it can be jarring and is best avoided.\n\naccord; accordance. The first word means \u201cagreement\u201d {we are in accord on the treaty\u2019s meaning} {we have reached an accord}. The second word means \u201cconformity\u201d {the book was printed in accordance with modern industry standards}.\n\nacquiesce. To acquiesce is to do what someone else wants or to passively allow something to happen. The connotation is usually acceptance without enthusiasm or even with opposition that is not acted on. The word traditionally takes the preposition in {the minority party acquiesced in the nomination}, although to is also accepted. With is not standard.\n\nactual fact, in. Redundant. Try actually instead, or simply omit.\n\nacuity; acumen. What is acute is sharp, and these two words apply to mental sharpness. Acuity most often refers to sharpness of perception\u2014the ability to think, see, or hear clearly {visual acuity}. Acumen always refers to mental prowess, especially the ability to think quickly and make good judgments.\n\nadduce; deduce; induce. To adduce is to give as a reason, offer as a proof, or cite as an example in order to prove that something is true {as evidence of reliability, she adduced her four years of steady volunteer work as a nurse\u2019s aide}. Deduce and induce are opposite processes. To deduce is to reason from general principles to specific conclusions, or to draw a specific conclusion from general knowledge {from these clues about who committed the crime, one deduces that the butler did it}. In a related logical sense, to induce is to form a general principle based on specific observations {after years of studying ravens, the researchers induced a few of their social habits}. In its more common uses, however, to induce is (1)\u00a0to persuade someone to do something, especially something unwise {nothing could induce me to try that again}, or (2)\u00a0to cause a particular physical response {induce labor} {induce vomiting}.\n\nadequate; sufficient; enough. Adequate refers to the suitability of something in a particular circumstance {an adequate explanation} {adequate provisions}. Sufficient refers to an amount that is enough to meet a particular need (always with an abstract concept, a mass noun, or a plural) {sufficient water} {sufficient information} {sufficient cause} {sufficient resources}. Enough, the best word for everyday purposes, meaning \u201cas much or as many as are needed or wanted,\u201d modifies both count nouns {enough people} and mass nouns {enough oil}.\n\nadherence; adhesion. With a few exceptions, the first term is figurative, the second literal. Your adherence to the transportation code requires the adhesion of an inspection sticker to your windshield.\n\nadjure. See abjure.\n\nadministrator. See executor.\n\nadmission; admittance. Admission is generally figurative, suggesting particularly the rights and privileges granted with permission to enter {the student won admission to a first-rate university} or the price paid for entry {admission is $10}. Admittance is more limited and more a matter of physical entry, but it too is tinged with the idea of permission {no admittance beyond this point}.\n\nadopted; adoptive. Adopted applies to a child or dependent {adopted son}. It is incorrect when applied to the ones who do the adopting; instead, use adoptive, the more general adjective corresponding to adopt {adoptive parents}.\n\nadverse; averse. Though etymologically related, these words have undergone differentiation. Adverse means either \u201cstrongly opposed\u201d or \u201cunfavorable\u201d and typically refers to things (not people) {adverse relations between the nations complicated matters} {an adverse wind blew the ship off course}. Averse means \u201cfeeling negatively about\u201d or \u201chaving a strong dislike or unwillingness,\u201d and it refers to people {he\u2019s averse to asking for directions}.\n\naffect; effect. Affect, almost always a verb, means \u201cto influence or do something that produces a change; to have an effect on\u201d {the adverse publicity affected the election}. To affect can also mean \u201cto pretend to have a particular feeling or manner\u201d {affecting a Scottish accent}. (The noun affect has a specialized meaning in psychology: emotional expressiveness. Consult your dictionary.) Effect, usually a noun, means \u201can outcome, result\u201d {the candidate\u2019s attempted explanations had no effect} or \u201ca change caused by an event, action, occurrence, etc.\u201d {harmful effects of smoking}. But it may also be a verb meaning \u201cto make happen, produce\u201d {the goal had been to effect a major change in campus politics}.\n\naffirmative, in the; in the negative. These are slightly pompous ways of saying yes and no. They result in part because people are unsure how to punctuate yes and no. The ordinary way is this: he said yes (without quotation marks around yes, and without a capital); she said no (ditto).\n\nafflict. See inflict.\n\naffront. See effrontery.\n\nafter having [+ past participle]. Though common, this phrasing is redundant. Try instead after [+ present participle]: change after having passed the audition, she\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. to after passing the audition, she\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. Or this: having passed the audition, she\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. See 5.110.\n\nafterward, adv.; afterword, n. The first means \u201clater\u201d; the second means \u201can epilogue.\u201d On afterward(s), see toward.\n\naggravate. Traditionally, aggravate most properly means \u201cto intensify (something bad)\u201d {aggravate an injury} {an aggravated crime}. If the sense is \u201cto bother,\u201d try annoy or irritate or exasperate instead.\n\naid; aide. Aid can be a verb (= to help) or a noun (= assistance). Aide is a noun (= helper), as in teacher\u2019s aide; in military parlance, it denotes someone assigned to help a superior officer {general\u2019s aide}.\n\nain\u2019t. This contraction is famously dialectal\u2014a word not to be used except either in the dialogue of a nonstandard speaker or in jest.\n\nalibi. Avoid this as a synonym for excuse. The traditional sense is \u201cthe defense of having been elsewhere when a crime was committed.\u201d\n\nall (of). Delete the of whenever possible {all the houses} {all my children}. The most common exception occurs when all of precedes a nonpossessive pronoun {all of us} {all of them}.\n\nalleged. Traditional usage applies this participial adjective to things, especially acts {alleged burglary}, not to the actors accused of doing them {alleged burglar}. That distinction is still observed by some publications, but it has largely been abandoned. Although allegedly \/\u0259-lej-\u0259d-lee\/ has four syllables, alleged has only two: \/\u0259-lejd\/.\n\nall ready. See already.\n\nall right. Two words. Avoid alright, which has long been regarded as nonstandard.\n\nall together. See altogether.\n\nallude; elude; illude. To allude is to hint at something indirectly {he alluded to the war by mentioning \u201cour recent national unpleasantness\u201d}. It\u2019s often loosely used where refer or quote would be better\u2014that is, where there is a direct mention or quotation. To elude is to avoid capture {the fox eluded the hunters}. To illude (quite rare) is to deceive {your imagination might illude you}.\n\nallusion; reference. An allusion is an indirect or casual mention or suggestion of something {the cockroach in this story is an allusion to Kafka}. A reference is a direct or formal mention {the references in this scholarly article have been meticulously documented}. See reference.\n\nalongside. This term, meaning \u201cat the side of,\u201d should not be followed by of.\n\na lot. Two words, not one.\n\nalready; all ready. The first refers to time {the movie has already started}; the second refers to preparation {are the actors all ready?}.\n\nalright. See all right.\n\naltar, n.; alter, vb. An altar is a table or similar object used for sacramental purposes. To alter is to change.\n\nalternate, adj. & n.; alternative, adj. & n. Alternate implies (1)\u00a0a substitute for another {we took the alternate route} or (2)\u00a0every other or every second {alternate Saturdays}. Alternative implies availability as another, usually sounder choice or possibility {alternative fuel sources}. The noun uses are analogous {the awards committee named her as alternate} {we have no alternative}.\n\naltogether; all together. Altogether means \u201cwholly\u201d or \u201centirely\u201d {that story is altogether false}. All together refers to a unity of time or place {the family will be all together at Thanksgiving}.\n\namend; emend. The first is the general term, meaning \u201cto change or add to something written or spoken\u201d {the city amended its charter to abolish at-large council districts} or \u201cto make better\u201d {amend your behavior!}. The second means \u201cto remove one or more mistakes from\u201d (as of a text) {for the second printing, the author emended several typos that had reached print in the first}. The noun corresponding to amend is amendment; the one corresponding to emend is emendation.\n\namiable; amicable. Both mean \u201cfriendly,\u201d but amiable refers to people who are easy to like {an amiable waiter} and amicable to relationships that involve goodwill and a lack of quarreling {an amicable divorce}.\n\namid. See between.\n\namong. See between.\n\namount; number. Amount is used with mass nouns {a decrease in the amount of pollution} {a small amount of money}. Number is used with count nouns {a growing number of dissidents} {the number of coins in your pocket}.\n\nan. See a.\n\nand. Popular belief to the contrary, this conjunction usefully begins sentences, typically outperforming moreover, additionally, in addition, further, and furthermore. Yet it does not occur as a sentence-starter as often as but. See but; see also 5.203.\n\nand\/or. Avoid this Janus-faced term. It can often be replaced by and or or with no loss in meaning. Where it seems needed {take a sleeping pill and\/or a warm drink}, try .\u00a0.\u00a0. or\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0, or both {take a sleeping pill or a warm drink, or both}. But think of other possibilities {take a sleeping pill, perhaps with a warm drink}.\n\nanecdotal. This adjective corresponds to anecdote, but in one sense the words have opposite connotations. An anecdote is a story that is thought (but not known) to be true. But anecdotal evidence refers to accounts that are suspect because they are not rigorously verified.\n\nangry. See mad.\n\nanxious. Avoid it as a synonym for eager. The standard sense is \u201cworried, nervous, distressed.\u201d\n\nanyone; any one. The one-word anyone is a singular indefinite pronoun used in reference to no one in particular {anyone would know that}. The two-word phrase any one is a more emphatic form of any, referring to a single person or thing in a group {do you recognize any one of those boys?} {I don\u2019t know any one of those stories}.\n\nanyplace. See anywhere.\n\nanyway; anyways. The former is standard; the latter, traditionally considered dialectal, has made inroads into the speech of many otherwise educated people born since about 1980. But it remains nonstandard.\n\nanywhere; any place. The first is preferred for an indefinite location {my keys could be anywhere}. But any place (two words) is narrower when you mean \u201cany location\u201d {they couldn\u2019t find any place to sit down and rest}. Avoid the informal one-word anyplace.\n\nappertain. See pertain.\n\nappraise; apprise. To appraise is to assess or put a value on something {the jeweler appraised the necklace}. To apprise is to inform or notify someone about something {keep me apprised of any developments}.\n\nappreciate. Three senses: (1)\u00a0to understand fully; (2)\u00a0to increase in value; (3)\u00a0to be grateful for (something). Sense 3 often results in verbose constructions; instead of I would appreciate it if you would let me know, try I would appreciate your letting me know or, more simply, please let me know.\n\napprise. See appraise.\n\napprove; endorse. Approve implies positive thought or a positive attitude rather than action apart from consent. Endorse implies both a positive attitude and active support.\n\napprove (of). Approve alone connotes official sanction or acceptance {the finance committee approved the proposed budget}. Approve of suggests thinking favorably about {she approved of her sister\u2019s new hairstyle}.\n\napproximately. See about.\n\napt; likely. Both mean \u201cfit, suitable,\u201d but apt is used for general tendencies or habits {the quarterback is apt to drop the football}. Likely expresses probability {because he didn\u2019t study, it\u2019s likely that he\u2019ll do poorly on the exam}. Although likely is traditional as a synonym of probable, many writers and editors object to its use as a synonym of probably. Apt has two other senses: (1)\u00a0\u201cexactly right for a given situation or purpose\u201d {an apt remark} and (2)\u00a0\u201cquick to learn\u201d {an apt pupil}.\n\narea. Often a nearly meaningless filler word, as in the area of partnering skills. Try deleting the area of. In the sciences, however, its more literal meaning is often important and should be retained. See also space.\n\nas far as. Almost always wordy. Avoid the nonstandard phrasing that uses as far as in place of as for\u2014that is, avoid using as far as without the completing verb is concerned or goes. Even with the verb, though, this is usually a wordy construction. Compare as far as change is concerned, it\u2019s welcome with as for change, it\u2019s welcome.\n\nas is. In reference to an acquisition, as is is framed in quotation marks and refers to the acceptance of something without guarantees or representations of quality {purchased \u201cas is\u201d}. The phrase on an \u201cas is\u201d basis is verbose.\n\nas of yet. See as yet.\n\nas per. This phrase, though common in the commercial world, has long been considered nonstandard. Instead of as per your request, write as you requested or (less good) per your request. The recent innovation as per usual for as usual is an illiteracy.\n\nassault; battery. These are popularly given the same meaning. But in law assault refers to a threat that causes someone to reasonably fear physical violence, and battery refers to a violent or repugnant intentional physical contact with another person. In the strict legal sense, an assault doesn\u2019t involve touching; a battery does.\n\nassemblage; assembly. An assemblage is an informal collection of people or things. An assembly is a group of people, especially decision makers, organized for a purpose {a national assembly}; a meeting {regular public assemblies}; or the process of putting together the parts of something {instructions for assembly}.\n\nassent; consent. The meanings are similar, but assent connotes a more affirmative agreement after careful consideration; consent connotes mere allowance, or sometimes grudging acquiescence.\n\nas such. This pronominal phrase always requires an antecedent for such {science is the organized search for truth and, as such, must be looked upon as an end in itself}. The phrase is now often loosely used as a synonym for therefore. Avoid this misusage {science seeks out truth in an organized way and, as such, must be looked upon as an end in itself}.\n\nassumption; presumption. An assumption is not drawn from strong evidence; typically, it is a hypothesis that one accepts as true without definite proof {your assumption can be tested by looking at the public records}. A presumption implies a basis in evidence or at least experience; if uncontradicted, a presumption may support a decision {the legal presumption of innocence}.\n\nassure. See ensure.\n\nas to. This two-word preposition is best used only to begin a sentence that could begin with on the question of or with regard to {as to those checks, she didn\u2019t know where they came from}. Otherwise, use about or some other preposition.\n\nas yet; as of yet. Stilted and redundant. Use yet, still, so far, or some other equivalent.\n\nattain; obtain. To attain something is either to accomplish it through effort (e.g., a goal) {she soon attained a position of power} or to reach a particular age, size, level, etc. {the stock market attained a new high this morning}. To obtain something is to get it or gain possession of it {obtaining information}. In best usage, you attain a degree and obtain a diploma. It can be a fine distinction, and in common usage the words are often treated as synonyms.\n\nat the present time; at this time; at present. These are turgid substitutes for now, today, currently, or even nowadays (a word of perfectly good literary standing). Of the three phrases, at present is least suggestive of bureaucratese.\n\nat the time that; at the time when. Use the plain and simple when instead.\n\nauger; augur. The spellings of these words can be tricky because they are pronounced the same \/aw-gr\/. The tool for boring is an auger. Augur means \u201ca clairvoyant or seer\u201d (noun) or \u201cto foretell\u201d (verb). Augurs well is an idiomatic equivalent of bodes well. The related noun augury refers to an indication of what will happen in the future.\n\navenge, vb.; revenge, vb. & n. Avenge connotes an exaction for a wrong {historically, family grudges were privately avenged}. The corresponding noun is vengeance. Revenge connotes the infliction of harm on another out of anger or resentment {the team is determined to revenge its humiliating loss in last year\u2019s championship game}. Revenge is much more commonly a noun {they didn\u2019t want justice\u2014they wanted revenge}.\n\naverse. See adverse.\n\navocation; vocation. An avocation is a hobby or pleasant pastime {stamp collecting is my weekend avocation}. A vocation is one\u2019s profession or, especially in a religious sense, one\u2019s calling {she had a true vocation and became a nun}.\n\nawhile; a while. The one-word version is adverbial; it means \u201cfor a short time\u201d {let\u2019s stop here awhile}. The two-word version is a noun phrase that follows the preposition for or in {she worked for a while before beginning graduate studies}.\n\nbackward(s). See toward.\n\nbale; bail. The somewhat less common term is bale (= a bundle or to form into a bundle, as of hay or cotton). Bail is most often a verb (= to drain by scooping, as of getting water out of a boat using a pail); it is also a noun and verb regarding the posting of security to get out of jail pending further proceedings. Bail is also used informally to denote leaving quickly or escaping {the couple bailed from the party}. To bail out someone (a phrasal verb) is to get the person out of trouble.\n\nbased on. This phrase has two legitimate and two illegitimate uses. It may unimpeachably have verbal force (base being a transitive verb, as in they based their position on military precedent) or, in a passive sense, adjectival force (based being read as a past-participial adjective, as in a sophisticated thriller based on a John le Carr\u00e9 novel). Two uses, however, are traditionally considered slipshod. Based on should not have adverbial force (as in Rates are adjusted annually, based on the 91-day Treasury bill) or prepositional force (as a dangling participle, as in Based on this information, we decided to stay). Try other constructions {rates are adjusted annually on the basis of the 91-day Treasury bill} {with this information, we decided to stay}.\n\nbasis. Much overworked, this word most properly means \u201cfoundation; the facts, things, or ideas from which something can be developed.\u201d It often appears in the phrase on a\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. basis or some similar construction. When possible, substitute adverbs (personally, not on a personal basis) or simply state the time (daily, not on a daily basis). The plural is bases {the legislative bases are complicated}.\n\nbated breath. So spelled\u2014not baited breath. Someone who waits with bated breath is anxious or excited (literally \u201cholding [abating] one\u2019s breath\u201d).\n\nbattery. See assault.\n\nbegging the question. This phrase traditionally denotes a logical fallacy of assuming as true what has yet to be proved\u2014or adducing as proof for some proposition something that\u2019s every bit as much in need of proof as the first proposition. For example, someone might try to \u201cprove\u201d the validity of a certain religion by quoting from that religion\u2019s holy text. But the phrase gets misused in many ways\u2014as (erroneously) meaning \u201cprompting a question,\u201d \u201cinviting an obvious question,\u201d \u201cevading a question,\u201d and \u201cignoring a question.\u201d\n\nbehalf. In behalf of means \u201cin the interest or for the benefit of\u201d {the decision is in behalf of the patient}. On behalf of means \u201cacting as agent or representative of\u201d {on behalf of Mr. Scott, I would like to express heartfelt thanks}.\n\nbemused. This word means \u201cbewildered, distracted, or confused.\u201d It is not a synonym of amused.\n\nbenevolence; beneficence. Benevolence is the attribute of being disposed to kindness or capable of doing good {the priest\u2019s benevolence was plainly evident}. It applies most often to people but may also apply to things that are beneficial. Beneficence is a major act of kindness or the performance of good deeds generally {the villagers thanked him for his beneficence}. The first term denotes a quality, the second conduct.\n\nbeside; besides. Beside is a preposition of position, whether literal {beside the road} or figurative {beside the point}. Besides may be a preposition meaning \u201cother than\u201d {who\u2019s going besides us?} or an adverb meaning \u201calso\u201d or \u201canyway\u201d {besides, who wants to know?}.\n\nbetween; among; amid. Between indicates one-to-one relationships {between you and me}. Among indicates undefined or collective relationships {honor among thieves}. Between has long been recognized as being perfectly appropriate for more than two objects if multiple one-to-one relationships are understood from the context {trade between members of the European Union}. Amid is often used with mass nouns {amid talk of war}\u2014though it can often be used with abstract nouns in the plural {resigned amid rumors of misconduct} {the investigation comes amid growing concerns}. Among is invariably used with plurals of count nouns {among the children}. Avoid amidst and amongst, especially in American English.\n\nbetween you and me. This is the correct phrasing\u2014not between you and I, which is a classic example of hypercorrection. Both pronouns function as objects of the preposition between. True, Shakespeare put the phrase \u2019tween you and I in a character\u2019s mouth, but that was at a time when English grammar was much less settled than it came to be in the eighteenth century\u2014and that usage was an outlier even in the Elizabethan era. Further, the sociolinguistic point that Shakespeare might have been making by having a character speak that phrase may well be lost in the mists of time.\n\nbi-; semi-. Generally, bi- means \u201ctwo\u201d (biweekly means \u201cevery two weeks\u201d), while semi- means \u201chalf\u201d (semiweekly means \u201ctwice a week\u201d). Because these prefixes are often confused with each other, writers should be explicit about the meaning.\n\nbiannual; semiannual; biennial. Biannual and semiannual both mean \u201ctwice a year\u201d {these roses bloom biannually}. But biennial means \u201conce every two years\u201d or \u201cevery other year\u201d {our legislature meets biennially}. To avoid confusion, write semiannual instead of biannual, and consider writing once every two years instead of biennial.\n\nbillion; trillion. The meanings can vary in different countries. In the United States, a billion is 1,000,000,000. In Great Britain, Canada, and Germany, a billion is traditionally a thousand times more than that (a million millions, or what Americans call a trillion)\u2014though the American English sense now predominates even in British English. Further, in Great Britain a trillion is traditionally a million million millions, what Americans would call a quintillion (1,000,000,000,000,000,000). Although the American definitions are gaining acceptance, writers need to remember the historical geographic distinctions. See also 9.8.\n\nblatant; flagrant. An act that is blatant is both bad and plain for all to see {a blatant error}. One that is flagrant is done brazenly as well as openly, often with a stronger suggestion of shocking illegality or immorality {a flagrant violation of the law}.\n\nbombastic. A bombastic speech or essay is pompously long-winded and self-important but essentially empty of substance. The word has nothing to do with temper.\n\nborn; borne. Born is used only as an adjective {a born ruler} or in the fixed passive-voice verb to be born {the child was born into poverty}. Borne is the general past participle of bear {this donkey has borne many heavy loads} {she has borne three children}. It is also used to form compound terms {foodborne} {vectorborne}.\n\nboth\u2013and. These correlative conjunctions should frame matching syntactic parts. Hence don\u2019t write She is both a writer and she skis professionally, but instead She is both a writer and a professional skier.\n\nbreach, n. & vb.; breech, n. A breach is a gap in or violation of something {a breach of contract} or a serious disagreement {healing the breach between the nations}. To breach is to break, break open, or break through {breach the castle walls}. Breech refers to the lower or back part of something, especially the buttocks {a breech birth} or the part of a modern firearm where bullets are inserted {the rifle\u2019s breech}.\n\nbring; take. The distinction may seem obvious, but the error is common. The simple question is, Where is the action directed? If it\u2019s toward you, use bring {bring home the bacon}. If it\u2019s away from you, use take {take out the trash}. You take (not bring) your car to the mechanic.\n\nbut. Popular belief to the contrary, this conjunction usefully begins contrasting sentences, typically with greater strength and speed than however. Avoid putting a comma after it. Cf. and; see also 5.203.\n\nby means of. Often verbose. Use by or with if either one suffices.\n\nby reason of. Use because or because of unless by reason of is part of an established phrase {by reason of insanity}.\n\ncache; cachet. Cache, a count noun, refers either to a quantity of goods or valuables that have been stashed away or to a storage buffer within a computer. Cachet, generally a mass noun, refers most commonly to prestige or fetching appeal\u2014or else a seal on a document or a commemorative design. Cachet sometimes appears, incorrectly, as cach\u00e9.\n\ncan; could. Can means \u201cto be able to\u201d and expresses certainty {I can be there in five minutes}. Could is better for a sense of uncertainty or a conditional statement {could you stop at the cleaners today?} {if you send a deposit, we could hold your reservation}. See 5.146.\n\ncan; may. Can most traditionally applies to physical or mental ability {she can do calculations in her head} {the dog can leap over a six-foot fence}. In colloquial English, can also expresses a request for permission {can I go to the movies?}, but this usage is not recommended in formal contexts. May suggests possibility {the class may have a pop quiz tomorrow} or permission {you may borrow my car}. A denial of permission is properly phrased formally with may not {you may not borrow my credit card} or, less formally, with cannot or can\u2019t {you can\u2019t use the computer tonight}. See 5.146, 5.147.\n\ncannon; canon. A cannon is an artillery weapon that fires metal balls or other missiles. A canon is (1)\u00a0a general rule or principle, (2)\u00a0an established criterion, (3)\u00a0the sum of a writer or composer\u2019s work, (4)\u00a0the collective literature accepted by a scholastic discipline, (5)\u00a0a piece of music in which a tune is started by one performer and is mimicked by each of the others, or (6)\u00a0a Christian priest having special duties within a church or cathedral.\n\ncapability. See ability.\n\ncapacity. See ability.\n\ncapital; capitol. A capital is a seat of government (usually a city) {Jefferson City is the capital of Missouri}. A capitol is a building in which a legislature meets {the legislature opened its new session in the capitol today}.\n\ncarat; karat; caret. Carat measures the weight of a gemstone; karat measures the purity of gold. To remember the difference, think of 24K gold. (In British English, the spelling carat serves in both senses.) Caret is a mark on a manuscript indicating where matter is to be inserted; borrowed from Latin in the seventeenth century, it literally means \u201c(something) is lacking.\u201d\n\ncareer; careen. The word career\u2019s career as a verb meaning \u201cto go full speed\u201d may be about over, except in British English (in which the two verbs contend in what is still a tight race). In American English, its duties have been assumed by careen (traditionally, \u201cto tip to one side while moving\u201d), even though nothing in that verb\u2019s time-honored definition denotes high speed. So today in American English it\u2019s typically careened down the hill but in British English careered down the hill.\n\ncaret. See carat.\n\ncase. This multifaceted word is often a sign of verbal inflation, especially in its uses as a near-synonym of situation. For example, in case means \u201cif\u201d; in most cases means \u201cusually\u201d; in every case means \u201calways.\u201d The word is justifiably used in law (in which a case is a lawsuit or judicial opinion) and in medicine (in which the word refers to an instance of a disease or disorder). By extension, it has analogous senses in social work, criminal detection, etc. Of course, the word can also denote a box or container {briefcase}, an argument or set of reasons {state your case}, or a grammatical word form.\n\ncause c\u00e9l\u00e8bre. This word most strictly denotes a legal case, especially a prosecution, that draws great public interest. By extension, it refers to a notorious episode, event, or even person. It does not properly denote a person\u2019s pet cause. Though it retains its acute and grave accents, the phrase is now considered naturalized enough not to be italicized (except when called out as a phrase, as in the next sentence). Yet the plural retains its French form: causes c\u00e9l\u00e8bres.\n\ncenser; censor, n.; sensor. The correct spellings can be elusive. A censer is either a person who carries a container of burning incense or the container itself. A censor is a person who suppresses objectionable subject matter. A sensor is a mechanical or electronic device for discovering light, heat, movement, etc.\n\ncensor, vb.; censure, vb. To censor is to review books, films, letters, and the like to remove objectionable material\u2014that is, to suppress {soldiers\u2019 letters are often censored in wartime}. To censure is to criticize strongly or disapprove, or to officially reprimand {the House of Representatives censured the president for the invasion} {in some countries the government censors the press; in the United States the press often censures the government}.\n\ncenter around. Although this illogical phrasing does have apologists, stylists tend to use either center on or revolve around.\n\ncertainty; certitude. If you are absolutely sure about something, you display both certainty (firm conviction) and certitude (assurance of being certain). That fact you are sure about, however, is a certainty but not a certitude\u2014the latter is a trait applied to people only.\n\nchair; chairman; chairwoman; chairperson. Chair is widely regarded as the best gender-neutral choice. Since the mid-seventeenth century, chair has referred to an office of authority. See also 5.251\u201360.\n\nchildish; childlike. Childlike is used positively to connote innocence, eagerness, and freshness {a childlike smile}. Childish is pejorative; it connotes immaturity, silliness, and unreasonableness {childish ranting}.\n\nchord; cord. Chord denotes (1)\u00a0a group of harmonically consonant notes {major chords} {minor chords} or (2)\u00a0a straight line joining the ends of an arc (sense 2 being a technical term in mathematics and engineering). Cord is the word denoting a thick string or rope {spinal cord} {umbilical cord} {vocal cord}, an enclosed wire that supplies electricity to an appliance or other equipment, or a quantity of firewood.\n\ncircumstances. Both in the circumstances and under the circumstances are acceptable, but under is now much more common in American English. In predominates in British English.\n\ncite, n.; site. As a noun, cite is colloquial for citation, which refers to a source of information {a cite to Encyclopaedia Britannica}. A site is a place or location used for a particular purpose {building site} {website}. Cf. sight.\n\ncitizen; subject. In a governmental sense, these are near-synonyms that should be distinguished. A citizen owes allegiance to a nation whose sovereignty is a collective function of the people {a citizen of Germany}. A subject owes allegiance to an individual sovereign because the form of government is monarchical {a subject of the queen}.\n\nclass. This word denotes a category or group of things that are considered together because of their similarities {the class of woodwind instruments}. Properly, a class is never one type {the oboe is a type of woodwind} or one kind of thing {a drum is one kind of percussion instrument}.\n\nclassic; classical. Classic means \u201cimportant, authoritative, outstanding\u201d {The Naked Night is one of Ingmar Bergman\u2019s classic films}. Classical applies to a traditional set of values in literature, music, design, and other fields {classical Greek} {a classical composer} or to the definitive or earliest-characterized form {classical EEC syndrome}.\n\nclean; cleanse. Although various cleaning agents are called \u201ccleansers,\u201d clean displaced cleanse long ago in most of the word\u2019s literal senses. Cleanse retains the Old English root meaning \u201cpure\u201d: its use today usually refers to spiritual or moral (or gastrointestinal) purification.\n\ncleave. This verb was originally two different words, and that difference is reflected in the opposite meanings that cleave has: (1)\u00a0to cut apart {to cleave meat} and (2)\u00a0to cling together {standing in the rain, his clothes cleaving to his body}. (When a term is its own antonym, it is known as a contronym.) The conjugations are (1)\u00a0cleave, cleft (or clove), cleft (or cloven); and (2)\u00a0cleave, cleaved, cleaved.\n\nclench; clinch. Clench, which connotes a physical action, normally involves a person\u2019s hands, teeth, jaw, or stomach {he clenched his hand into a fist}. Clinch, the more common term, has mostly figurative uses about finally achieving something after a struggle {clinched the title} {clinched the victory}. But there is an exception to the nonphysical uses of clinch: if two people clinch, they hold each other\u2019s arms tightly, as in boxing.\n\nclimactic; climatic. Climactic is the adjective corresponding to climax {during the movie\u2019s climactic scene, the projector broke}. Climatic corresponds to climate {the climatic conditions of northern New Mexico}.\n\nclinch. See clench.\n\nclose proximity. Redundant. Write either close or in proximity.\n\nclosure; cloture. Closure denotes the temporary or permanent closing or final resolution of something. Cloture denotes the parliamentary procedure of closing debate and taking a vote on a legislative bill or other measure.\n\ncohabit; cohabitate. Cohabit is the traditional verb for living with another person in a sexual relationship without being married. Cohabitate, a back-formation from cohabitation, is best avoided.\n\ncollaborate; corroborate. To collaborate is to cooperate on some undertaking, especially in the arts or sciences {the participants are collaborators}. To corroborate something is to back up its reliability with proof or evidence {the expert corroborated the witness\u2019s testimony}.\n\ncollegial; collegiate. Collegial answers to colleague {a healthy collegial work environment}; collegiate answers to college {collegiate sports}.\n\ncommendable; commendatory. What is done for a worthy cause is commendable {commendable dedication to helping the poor}. What expresses praise is commendatory {commendatory plaque}.\n\ncommon; mutual. What is common is shared by two or more people {borne by different mothers but having a common father}. What is mutual is reciprocal or directly exchanged by and toward each other {mutual obligations}. Strictly, friend in common is better than mutual friend in reference to a third person who is a friend of two others.\n\ncommonweal; commonwealth. The commonweal is the public welfare. Traditionally, a commonwealth was a state established by public compact or by the consent of the people to promote the general good (commonweal), and where the people reserved supreme authority. In the United States, the word is synonymous with state, four of which are still called commonwealths: Kentucky, Massachusetts, Pennsylvania, and Virginia. The Commonwealth of Puerto Rico is also a US territory.\n\ncompare. To compare with is to discern both similarities and differences between things. To compare to is to liken things or to note primarily similarities between them, especially in the active voice {Are you comparing me to him? I hope not!}.\n\ncompelled; impelled. If you are compelled to do something, you have no choice in the matter {Nixon was compelled by the unanimous Supreme Court decision to turn over the tapes}. If you are impelled to do something, you still may not like it, but you are convinced that it must be done {the voter disliked some candidates but was impelled by the income-tax issue to vote a straight-party ticket}. Whereas compel connotes an outside force, impel connotes an inner drive.\n\ncompendious; voluminous. These are not synonyms, as many apparently believe. Compendious means \u201cconcise, abridged.\u201d Voluminous, literally \u201coccupying many volumes,\u201d most commonly means \u201cvast\u201d or \u201cextremely lengthy.\u201d\n\ncomplacent; complaisant; compliant. To be complacent is to be content with oneself and one\u2019s life\u2014with the suggestion that one may be smugly unwilling to improve or unprepared for future trouble. To be complaisant is to be easygoing and eager to please others. To be compliant is to be amenable to orders or to a regimen imposed by others.\n\ncompliment; complement. A compliment is a flattering or praising remark {a compliment on your skill}. A complement is something that completes or brings to perfection {the lace tablecloth was a complement to the antique silver}. The words are also verbs: to compliment is to praise, while to complement is to supplement adequately or to complete. In the grammatical sense, a complement is a word or phrase that follows the verb to complete the predicate. The corresponding adjectives are complimentary, meaning (1)\u00a0\u201cexpressing praise\u201d or (2)\u00a0\u201cgiven to someone free of charge\u201d; and complementary, meaning (1)\u00a0\u201cgoing well together, despite differences,\u201d or (2)\u00a0\u201cconsisting of two geometric angles that, added together, take up 90 degrees.\u201d\n\ncomprise; compose. Use with care. To comprise is \u201cto consist of, to include\u201d {the whole comprises the parts}. To compose is \u201cto make up, to form the substance of something\u201d {the parts compose the whole}. The phrase is comprised of, though increasingly common, remains nonstandard. Instead, try is composed of or consists of. See include.\n\nconcept; conception. Both words may refer to an abstract thought, but conception also means \u201cthe act of forming an abstract thought.\u201d Avoid using either word as a high-sounding equivalent of idea, design, thought, or program.\n\ncondole, vb.; console, vb. These are closely related but not identical. To condole with is to express sympathy to {community leaders condoled with the victims\u2019 families}. The corresponding noun is condolence {they expressed their condolences at the funeral}. To console is to comfort in a time of distress or disappointment {the players consoled their humiliated coach}. The corresponding noun is consolation {their kind words were small consolation}.\n\nconfidant; confidante; confident. A confidant is a close companion, someone (male or female) you confide in. Confidante, a feminine form, is a fading alternative spelling of confidant (used only in reference to a female confidant). It reflects French gender spellings. Confident is the adjective meaning \u201csure that something will happen in the way one wants or expects\u201d or \u201csure that something is true.\u201d\n\ncongruous; congruent. Both terms mean \u201cin harmony, in agreement.\u201d The first is seen most often in its negative form, incongruous, meaning \u201cstrange, unexpected, or unsuitable in a particular situation\u201d {the modern house looks incongruous in this old neighborhood}. The second is used in math to describe triangles that are identical in their angles as well as in the length of their sides {congruent angles}.\n\nconnote; denote. To connote (in reference to language) is to convey a meaning beyond the basic one, especially through emotive nuance {the new gerund parenting and all that it connotes}. To denote (again in reference to language) is to specify the literal meaning of something {the phrase freezing point denotes 32 degrees Fahrenheit or 0 degrees Celsius}. Both words have figurative uses {all the joy that parenthood connotes} {a smile may not denote happiness}.\n\nconsent. See assent.\n\nconsequent; subsequent. The first denotes causation; the second does not. A consequent event always happens after the event that caused it, as does a subsequent event. But a subsequent event does not necessarily occur as a result of the first: it could be wholly unrelated but merely later in time.\n\nconsider. Add as only when you mean \u201cto examine or discuss for a particular purpose\u201d {handshaking considered as a means of spreading disease}. Otherwise, omit as {we consider him qualified}.\n\nconsist. There are two distinct phrases: consist of and consist in. The first, by far the more common one, applies to the physical components that make up a tangible thing {the computer-system package consists of software, the CPU, the monitor, and a printer}. The second refers to the essence of a thing, especially in abstract terms {moral government consists in rewarding the righteous and punishing the wicked}.\n\nconsole. See condole.\n\ncontact, vb. If you mean write or call or email, say so. But contact is undeniably a brief way of referring to communication without specifying the means.\n\ncontagious; infectious. Both broadly describe a disease that is communicable. But a contagious disease spreads by direct contact with an infected person or animal {rabies is a contagious disease}. An infectious disease is spread by germs on a contaminated object or element, such as earth or water {tetanus is infectious but not contagious}.\n\ncontemporary; contemporaneous. Both express coinciding time, but contemporary usually applies to people, and contemporaneous applies to things or actions. Because contemporary has the additional sense \u201cmodern,\u201d it is unsuitable for contexts involving multiple times. That is, a reference to Roman, Byzantine, and contemporary belief systems is ambiguous; change contemporary to modern.\n\ncontemptuous; contemptible. If you are contemptuous, you are feeling and showing that you think someone or something deserves no respect. If you are contemptible, others will have that attitude toward you.\n\ncontent; contents. Content applies to the ideas, facts, or opinions in a written or oral presentation {the lecture\u2019s content was offensive to some who were present}. Contents usually denotes physical ingredients: the things that are inside a box, bag, room, or other container {the package\u2019s contents were difficult to discern by x-ray}. If the usage suggests many items, material or nonmaterial, contents is correct {table of contents} {the investigative report\u2019s contents}.\n\ncontinual; continuous. What is continual may go on for a long time, but always there are brief interruptions, so that it can be characterized as intermittent or frequently repeated {continual nagging}. What is continuous never stops\u2014it remains constant or uninterrupted {continuous flow of water}. A line that is continuous has no gaps or holes in it.\n\ncontravene; controvert. To contravene is to conflict with or violate (the law, a rule, etc.) {the higher speed limit contravenes our policy of encouraging fuel conservation}. To controvert is to challenge or contradict {the testimony controverts the witness\u2019s prior statement}.\n\nconvince. See persuade.\n\ncopyright, vb. This verb, meaning \u201cto obtain the legal right to be the only producer or seller of a book, play, film, or other creative work for a specific length of time,\u201d is conjugated copyright\u2013copyrighted\u2013copyrighted. Note the spelling, which has nothing to do with write.\n\ncord. See chord.\n\ncorollary; correlation. A corollary is either (1)\u00a0a subsidiary proposition that follows from a proven mathematical proposition, often without requiring additional evidence to support it, or (2)\u00a0a natural or incidental result of some action or occurrence. A correlation is a positive connection between things or phenomena. If used in the context of physics or statistics, it denotes the degree to which the observed interactions and variances are not attributable to chance alone.\n\ncorporal; corporeal. What is corporal relates in some way to the body {corporal punishment}; what is corporeal has a physical form that can be touched {not our spiritual but our corporeal existence}.\n\ncorps; core. A corps is a body of like workers, as in an army, with special duties and responsibilities {Marine Corps} {press corps}. It is often misspelled like its homophone, core, which denotes the central or most important part of something {the core of the problem} {the earth\u2019s core}.\n\ncorrelation. See corollary.\n\ncorroborate. See collaborate.\n\ncould. See can.\n\ncouldn\u2019t care less. This is the standard phrasing. Avoid the illogical form could care less.\n\ncouncillor; counselor. A councillor is one who sits on a council {city councillor}. A counselor is one whose job is to help and advise people with problems {personal counselor}. In British English, the spelling is counsellor.\n\ncouple. Using couple as an adjective has traditionally been regarded as nonstandard phrasing\u2014though it is increasingly common as a casualism. Add of {we watched a couple of movies}. When referring to two people as a unit {married couple}, the noun couple takes either a singular or a plural verb {the couple is happy} {the couple are honeymooning in Ravello}. When the pronoun they follows couple\u2014if a pronoun is used at all, it is normally plural\u2014the plural verb is preferable {the couple were delighted by their friends\u2019 responses}.\n\ncourt-martial. Two words joined by a hyphen, whether the phrase functions as a noun or as a verb. Because martial acts as an adjective meaning \u201cmilitary,\u201d the plural of the noun is courts-martial. The third-person-singular verb is court-martials {if the general court-martials him, he\u2019ll have much to answer for}. In American English, the inflected spellings of the verb are court-martialed, court-martialing; in British English, the spellings are court-martialled, court-martialling.\n\ncredible; creditable; credulous. Credible means \u201cbelievable; deserving trust\u201d; creditable means \u201cpraiseworthy; deserving approval\u201d; credulous means \u201cgullible; tending to believe whatever one is told\u2014and therefore easily deceived.\u201d The most common error involving cognate forms of these words is in the malapropism strains credulity. If some form of that clich\u00e9 must be used, it should read strains credibility.\n\ncrevice; crevasse. Size matters. A crack in the sidewalk is a crevice (accent on the first syllable) because it\u2019s narrow and typically not very deep; a fissure in a glacier or a dam is a crevasse (accent on the second syllable) because it\u2019s a deep open crack.\n\ncriminal. See unlawful.\n\ncriteria. This is the plural form of criterion (= a standard for judging): one criterion, two criteria. The double plural criterias is a solecism.\n\ndamp, vb.; dampen. Both words convey the sense \u201cto moisten.\u201d Damp also means \u201cto reduce with moisture\u201d {damp the fire} or \u201cto diminish vibration or oscillation of [a wire or voltage]\u201d {damp the voltage}. In a figurative sense, dampen means \u201cto make [a feeling, mood, activity, etc.] less intense or enjoyable\u201d {dampen one\u2019s hopes}.\n\ndata. Though originally this word was a plural of datum, it is now commonly treated as a mass noun and coupled with a singular verb. In formal writing (and always in the sciences), use data as a plural. Whatever you do, though, use the term consistently within a single writing\u2014either singular or (more formally) plural.\n\ndeadly; deathly. Deadly means \u201ccapable of causing death\u201d {deadly snake venom} or \u201clikely to cause as much harm as possible\u201d {deadly enemies}. Deathly means \u201carousing thoughts of death or a dead body\u201d {deathly silence}.\n\ndecide whether; decide if. See determine whether.\n\ndecimate. This word literally means \u201cto kill every tenth person,\u201d a means of repression that goes back to Roman times. But the word has come to mean \u201cto inflict heavy damage or destroy a large part of something,\u201d and this use has long been predominant. Avoid decimate when you are referring to complete destruction. That is, don\u2019t say that a city was completely decimated.\n\ndeduce. See adduce.\n\ndefamation; libel; slander. Defamation is the communication of a falsehood that damages someone\u2019s reputation. If it is recorded, especially in writing, it is libel; otherwise, it is slander.\n\ndefinite; definitive. Definite means \u201cclear, exact\u201d {a definite yes}. Definitive means either \u201cnot subject to further revision in the near future\u201d {we have a definitive agreement} or \u201cof such high quality as to be unimprovable for a long time\u201d {the definitive guide}.\n\ndelegate. See relegate.\n\ndeliberate, adj.; deliberative. As an adjective, deliberate means either \u201cplanned; carefully thought out\u201d {a deliberate response} or \u201cslow and steady\u201d {deliberate progress}. Deliberative means \u201cof, characterized by, or involving debate\u201d; the word most often applies to an assembly {deliberative body} or a process {deliberative meetings}.\n\ndenote. See connote.\n\ndenounce; renounce. To denounce is either to criticize harshly, especially in public {they denounced the prisoner swap}, or to accuse, as by giving incriminating information about someone\u2019s illegal political activities to the authorities {denounced him to the police}. To renounce is either to relinquish or reject {renounced her citizenship} or to declare publicly that one no longer believes something or will no longer behave in some way {renounce violence}.\n\ndependant, n.; dependent, adj. & n. In British English, the first is the preferable noun {he claimed three dependants on his tax return}; the second is the adjective {the family has become dependent on welfare}. But in American English, dependent is the usual form as both noun and adjective.\n\ndepend on. Although upon is best reduced to on in this phrase, no further reduction is idiomatic: depend demands an on. Hence don\u2019t write That depends how we approach the problem but rather That depends on how we approach the problem.\n\ndeprecate. In general, to deprecate is to strongly disapprove or criticize. But in the phrase self-deprecating\u2014which began as a mistaken form of self-depreciating but is now standard\u2014the sense of deprecate is \u201cto belittle.\u201d In computing, deprecate serves as a warning: a deprecated feature or function is one that may be phased out of a future release of software, so users should begin looking for alternatives.\n\nderisive; derisory. What is derisive ridicules as stupid or silly {derisive laughter}. What is derisory invites or deserves ridicule {that derisory \u201cbanana\u201d hat}, especially when a laughably small amount of money is offered or given {my derisory paychecks}.\n\ndeserts; desserts. The first are deserved {he got his just deserts}, the second eaten {the many desserts on the menu}. Just desserts is a common misspelling (unless the meaning is \u201conly postprandial sweets\u201d).\n\ndespite; in spite of. For brevity, prefer despite.\n\ndetermine whether; determine if. The first phrasing is irreproachable style; the second is acceptable as a colloquialism. The same is true of decide whether versus decide if.\n\ndifferent. The phrasing different from is generally considered preferable to different than {this company is different from that one}, but sometimes the adverbial phrase differently than is all but required {she described the scene differently than he did}. In British English, different to is not uncommon\u2014but it is distinctively British English, whereas different from is standard everywhere.\n\ndiffer from; differ with. Differ from is the usual construction denoting a contrast {the two species differ from each other in subtle ways}. Differ with regards differences of opinion {the state\u2019s senators differ with each other on many issues}.\n\ndisburse; disperse. To disburse is to distribute money, especially from a large sum available for some specific purpose. To disperse is (1)\u00a0to spread in various directions over a wide area {the clouds dispersed} or (2)\u00a0to cause to go away in different directions {police dispersed the unruly crowd}.\n\ndisc. See disk.\n\ndiscomfort; discomfit. Discomfort is a noun meaning \u201cill at ease.\u201d It can also be used as a verb meaning \u201cto put ill at ease.\u201d But doing so often invites confusion with discomfit, which originally meant \u201cto defeat utterly.\u201d Today it means \u201cto thwart, confuse, annoy, or embarrass\u201d {the ploy discomfited the opponent}. The distinction has become a fine one, since a discomfited person is also uncomfortable. Discomfiture is the corresponding noun.\n\ndiscreet; discrete. Discreet means either \u201ccareful about not divulging secrets or upsetting others\u201d {a discreet silence} or \u201cshowing modest taste; nonostentatious\u201d {discreet jewelry}. Discrete means \u201cseparate, distinct, unconnected\u201d {six discrete parts}.\n\ndiscriminating, adj.; discriminatory. The word discrimination can be used in either a negative or a positive sense, and these adjectives reflect that ambivalence. Discriminatory means \u201creflecting a biased, unfair treatment\u201d {discriminatory employment policy}. Discriminating means \u201canalytically refined, discerning, tasteful\u201d {a discriminating palate}.\n\ndisinterested. This word should be reserved for the sense \u201cnot having a financial personal interest at stake and therefore able to judge a situation fairly; impartial.\u201d Avoid it as a replacement for uninterested (which means \u201cunconcerned, bored\u201d).\n\ndisk; disc. Disk is the usual spelling {hard disk} {disk drive}. But disc is preferred in a few specialized applications {compact disc} {disc brakes} {disc harrow}\u2014particularly where the object in question is circular and flat.\n\ndisorganized; unorganized. Both mean \u201cnot organized,\u201d but disorganized suggests (1)\u00a0a group in disarray, either thrown into confusion or inherently unable to work together {the disorganized 1968 Democratic National Convention in Chicago}, or (2)\u00a0a person who is exceedingly bad at arranging or planning things {disorganized students}.\n\ndisperse. See disburse.\n\ndistinctive; distinguished; distinguishable. A distinctive feature is something that makes a person (or place or thing) easy to recognize {U2\u2019s distinctive sound}. But it does not necessarily make that person distinguished (respected and admired) {the distinguished professor wears a distinctive red bow tie}. It does, however, make the person distinguishable (easy to see as being different from something else)\u2014a term that does not carry the positive connotation of distinguished.\n\ndive, vb. The preferred conjugation has traditionally been dive\u2013dived\u2013dived. The irregular form dove, though, has become the slightly predominant past-tense form in American English and should be accepted as standard: dive\u2013dove\u2013dived. Traditionalists will stick to the older inflection.\n\ndoctrinal; doctrinaire. Doctrinal means \u201cof, relating to, or constituting a doctrine\u201d; it is neutral in connotation {doctrinal differences}. Doctrinaire means \u201cdogmatic,\u201d suggesting that the person described is stubborn and narrow-minded {a doctrinaire ideologue}.\n\ndoubtfully, adv. In recent years, this term has come into use as a sentence adverb functioning as a correlative of hopefully and as an antonym of undoubtedly {Will you be attending the party? Hopefully\u2014but doubtfully. [That is, I hope I\u2019ll be able to go, but I doubt it.]}. Should you abstain from this usage in Standard Written English? No doubt.\n\ndoubtless, adv. Use this form (it\u2019s called a flat adverb)\u2014not doubtlessly. See also 5.160.\n\ndoubt that; doubt whether; doubt if. Doubt that conveys a negative sense of strong skepticism or questioning {I doubt that you\u2019ll ever get your money back}. Doubt whether also conveys a sense of skepticism, though less strong {the official says that he doubts whether the company could survive}. Doubt if is a casual phrasing for doubt that.\n\ndrag. Conjugated drag\u2013dragged\u2013dragged. The past form drug is dialectal.\n\ndream. Either dreamed (more typical in both American English and British English) or dreamt is acceptable for the past-tense and past-participial forms.\n\ndrink, vb. Correctly conjugated drink\u2013drank\u2013drunk {they had not drunk any fruit juice that day}.\n\ndrown, vb. Conjugated drown\u2013drowned\u2013drowned.\n\ndrunk, adj.; drunken. Drunk describes a current state of intoxication {drunk driver}. (By contrast, a drunk\u2014like a drunkard\u2014is someone who is habitually intoxicated.) Drunken describes either a trait of habitual intoxication {drunken sot} or intoxicated people\u2019s behavior {a drunken brawl}.\n\ndual; duel. Dual is an adjective meaning \u201chaving two parts or two of something\u201d {dual exhaust}. A duel is a fight between two people, especially a formal and often deadly combat with pistols or swords.\n\ndue to. In strict traditional usage, due to should be interchangeable with attributable to {the erratic driving was due to some prescription drugs that the driver had taken} or owed to {thanks are due to all who helped}. When used adverbially, due to is often considered inferior to because of or owing to. So in the sentence Due to the parents\u2019 negligence, the entire family suffered, the better phrasing would be Because of [or Owing to] the parents\u2019 negligence, the entire family suffered.\n\ndue to the fact that. Use because instead.\n\ndumb. This word means either \u201cstupid\u201d or \u201cunable to speak.\u201d In the second sense, the adjective mute is clearer (and less offensive) for most modern readers. But on the noun use of mute, see moot.\n\ndying; dyeing. Dying is the present participle of die (= to cease living); dyeing is the present participle of dye (= to color with a liquid).\n\neach. As a noun serving as the subject of a clause, each takes a singular verb {each of them was present that day}. But when it serves as an emphatic appositive for a plural noun, the verb is plural {they each have their virtues} {the newspapers each sell for $3}.\n\neach other; one another. Traditionalists use each other when two things or people are involved, one another when more than two are involved.\n\neatable. See edible.\n\neconomic; economical. Economic means \u201cof, relating to, or involving large-scale finances\u201d {federal economic policy}. Economical means \u201cthrifty; financially efficient; cheap and not wasteful\u201d {an economical purchase}.\n\nedible; eatable. What is edible is fit for human consumption {edible flowers}. What is eatable is at least minimally palatable {the cake is slightly burned but still eatable}.\n\neffect. See affect.\n\neffete. Traditionally, it has meant \u201cworn out, sterile\u201d or \u201clacking power, character, or vitality.\u201d Today it is often used to mean \u201csnobbish,\u201d \u201ceffeminate,\u201d or \u201cunduly pampered.\u201d Because of its ambiguity, the word is best avoided altogether.\n\neffrontery; affront. Effrontery is an act of shameless impudence or shocking audacity. An affront is a deliberate insult.\n\ne.g. See i.e.\n\n\neither. Like neither, this word takes a singular verb when it functions as subject {is either of the spouses present today?}.\n\nelemental; elementary. Something that is elemental is an essential constituent {elemental ingredients} or a power of nature {elemental force}. Something that is elementary is basic, introductory, or easy {an elementary math problem}.\n\nelicit; illicit. To elicit information or a reaction is to get it from someone, especially in challenging circumstances {to elicit responses}. Something illicit is disallowed by law or rule and usually also condemned generally by society {an illicit scheme}. Writers often mistakenly use the adjective illicit when they need the verb elicit.\n\nelude. See allude.\n\nembarrass. See harass.\n\nemend. See amend.\n\nemigrate. See immigrate.\n\neminent; imminent. What is eminent is famous, important, and respected {the eminent professor} or derives from high standing or authority {eminent domain}. What is imminent is looming, likely to happen soon, and almost always bad {imminent disaster}.\n\nemoji; emoticon. An emoji (from the Japanese; pl. emoji) is a pictorial representation, or ideogram, that consists of a face, a hand gesture, or an object or symbol intended to express or suggest an emotion or attitude\u2014or any number of ideas or things. An emoticon is a representation of a smiley face or other expressive gesture rendered as a combination of common keyboard characters\u2014e.g., ;-).\n\nemotive; emotional. The first means \u201carousing intense feeling\u201d {emotive language calculated to persuade the jury}; the second means \u201cof, relating to, or involving intense feelings\u201d {an emotional response}.\n\nempathy; sympathy. Empathy is the ability to understand other people\u2019s feelings and problems {tremendous empathy with others}. Sympathy is generally compassion and sorrow one feels for another\u2019s misfortunes, especially on a particular occasion {our sympathies are with you}\u2014but it can also be support for a plan or idea {right-wing sympathies} or a mutual understanding and warmth arising from compatibility {there was no personal sympathy between them}.\n\nendemic. See epidemic.\n\nendorse. See approve.\n\nenervate; innervate. These words are antonyms. To enervate is to weaken or drain of energy. To innervate is to stimulate or provide with energy.\n\nenormity; enormousness. Enormity means \u201cmonstrousness, moral outrageousness, atrociousness\u201d {the enormity of the Khmer Rouge\u2019s killings}. Enormousness means \u201chugeness\u201d or \u201cimmensity\u201d {the enormousness of Alaska}.\n\nenough. See adequate.\n\nenquire. See inquire.\n\nensure; insure; assure. Ensure is the general term meaning \u201cto make sure that something will (or won\u2019t) happen.\u201d In best usage, insure is reserved for underwriting financial risk. So we ensure that we can get time off for a vacation, and we insure our car against an accident on the trip. We ensure events and insure things. But we assure people of things by telling them what\u2019s what, so that they won\u2019t worry. The important thing to remember is that we ensure occurrences and assure people.\n\nenthused, adj. Use enthusiastic instead.\n\nenumerable; innumerable. What\u2019s enumerable is countable and listable {the enumerable issues that we need on the agenda}. What\u2019s innumerable can\u2019t be counted, at least not practically {innumerable stars in the sky}. The second word is far more common. Because the two are pronounced so similarly, be wary of using them in speech.\n\nenvy. See jealousy.\n\nepidemic; endemic; pandemic. An epidemic disease breaks out, spreads through a limited area (such as a state), and then subsides {an epidemic outbreak of measles}. (The word is frequently used as a noun {a measles epidemic}.) An endemic disease is perennially present within a region or population {malaria is endemic in parts of Africa}. (Note that endemic describes a disease and not a region: it is incorrect to say this region is endemic for [a disease].) A pandemic disease is prevalent over a large area, such as a nation or continent, or the entire world {the 1918\u201319 flu pandemic}.\n\nequally as. This is typically faulty phrasing. Delete as.\n\net al. This is the abbreviated form of et alii (\u201cand others\u201d)\u2014the others being people, not things. Since al. is an abbreviation, the period is required\u2014but note that no period follows the et (Latin for \u201cand\u201d). Cf. etc.\n\n\netc. This is the abbreviated form of et cetera (\u201cand other things\u201d); it should never be used in reference to people. Etc. implies that a list of things is too extensive to recite. But often writers seem to run out of thoughts and tack on etc. for no real purpose. Also, two redundancies often appear with this abbreviation: (1)\u00a0and etc., which is poor style because et means \u201cand,\u201d and (2)\u00a0etc. at the end of a list that begins with for example, such as, e.g., and the like. Those terms properly introduce a short list of examples. Cf. et al.; see also 6.20.\n\nevent. The phrase in the event that is a verbose and formal way of saying if.\n\neventuality. This term often needlessly displaces more specific everyday words such as event, result, and possibility.\n\nevery day, adv.; everyday, adj. The first is adverbial, the second adjectival. You may wear your everyday clothes every day.\n\nevery one; everyone. The two-word version is an emphatic way of saying \u201ceach\u201d {every one of them was there}; the second is a pronoun equivalent to everybody {everyone was there}.\n\neverywhere. This is the preferable word\u2014not everyplace.\n\nevoke; invoke. To evoke something is to bring it out {evoke laughter} or bring it to mind {evoke childhood memories}. Invoke has a number of senses, including to assert (something) as authority {invoke the Monroe Doctrine}, to appeal (to someone or a higher power) for help {invoke an ally to intervene}, and to conjure up {invoke spirits of the past}.\n\nexceptional; exceptionable. What is exceptional is uncommon, superior, rare, or extraordinary {an exceptional talent}. What is exceptionable is objectionable or offensive {an exceptionable slur}.\n\nexecutor; administrator. In a will, a person designates an executor to distribute the estate after death. When a person dies without a will or without specifying an executor, the court will appoint an administrator to do the same. The feminine forms administratrix and executrix are unnecessary and should be avoided.\n\nexplicit; implicit. If something is explicit, it is deliberately and clearly spelled out, as in the text of a well-drafted statute. If it is implicit, it is not specifically stated but is either suggested in the wording or necessary to effectuate the purpose. Avoid implicit to mean \u201ccomplete, unmitigated.\u201d\n\nfact that, the. This much-maligned phrase is not always avoidable. But hunt for a substitute before deciding to use it. Sometimes that alone suffices.\n\nfarther; further. The traditional distinction is to use farther for a physical distance {we drove farther north to see the autumn foliage} and further for a figurative distance {let\u2019s examine this further} {look no further}. Although it\u2019s a refinement of slight importance, connoisseurs will appreciate it.\n\nfaze; phase, vb. To faze is to disturb or disconcert {Jones isn\u2019t fazed by insults}. To phase (usually phase in or phase out) is to schedule or perform a plan, task, or the like in stages {phase in new procedures} {phase out the product lines that don\u2019t sell}. The negative adjective for \u201cunaffected\u201d is unfazed, not unphased.\n\nfeel. This verb is weak when used as a substitute for think or believe.\n\nfeel bad. Invariably, the needed phrase is feel bad (not feel badly). See 5.170.\n\nfewer. See less.\n\nfictional; fictitious; fictive. Fictional (from fiction as a literary genre) means \u201cof, relating to, or involving imagination\u201d {a fictional story}. Fictitious means \u201cimaginary; counterfeit; false\u201d {a fictitious name}. Fictive means \u201cpossessing the talent for imaginative creation\u201d {fictive gift}; although it can also be a synonym for fictional, in that sense it is a needless variant. Also, anthropologists use fictive to describe relationships in which people are treated as family members despite having no bond of blood or marriage {fictive kin}.\n\nfinalize. Meaning \u201cto bring to an end or finish the last part of,\u201d this word has often been associated with inflated jargon. Although its compactness may recommend it in some contexts, use finish when possible.\n\nfirst. In enumerations, use first, second, third, and so on. Avoid the -ly forms.\n\nfit. This verb is undergoing a shift. It has traditionally been conjugated fit\u2013fitted\u2013fitted, but today fit\u2013fit\u2013fit is prevalent in American English {when she tried on the dress, it fit quite well}. In the passive voice, however, fitted is still normal {the horse was fitted with a new harness}.\n\nflagrant. See blatant.\n\nflair. See flare.\n\nflammable; inflammable. Flammable was invented in the early twentieth century as an alternative to the synonymous word inflammable, which some people misunderstood\u2014dangerously\u2014as meaning \u201cnot combustible.\u201d Today flammable is the standard term. Its antonym is nonflammable.\n\nflare; flair. A flare is an unsteady and glaring light {an emergency flare} or a sudden outburst {a flare-up of fighting}. A flair is an outstanding talent {a flair for mathematics} or originality and stylishness {performed with flair}.\n\nflaunt; flout. Flaunt means \u201cto show off ostentatiously\u201d {they flaunted their wealth}. Flout means \u201cto openly disobey\u201d {they flouted the rules}.\n\nflounder; founder. Although the figurative sense of both verbs is \u201cto go wrong,\u201d the literal senses evoke different images. To flounder is to struggle awkwardly, as though walking through deep mud {the professor glared while the unprepared student floundered around for an answer}. To founder (usually in reference to a boat or ship) is to sink or run aground {the ship foundered on the rocks}.\n\nflout. See flaunt.\n\nfollowing. Avoid this word as an equivalent of after. Consider the possible miscue in Following the presentation, there was a question-and-answer session. After is both simpler and clearer.\n\nforbear, vb.; forebear, n. The terms are unrelated, but the spellings are frequently confused. To forbear is to refrain {he wanted to speak but decided to forbear [the conjugation is forbear\u2013forbore\u2013forborne]}. A forebear is an ancestor {the house was built by Murray\u2019s distant forebears}.\n\nforego; forgo. To forego is to go before {the foregoing paragraph}. The word appears most commonly in the phrase foregone conclusion. To forgo, by contrast, is to do without or renounce {they decided to forgo that opportunity}.\n\nforeword; preface. A book\u2019s foreword (not forward) is an introductory essay written by someone other than the book\u2019s author. An introductory essay written by the book\u2019s author is called a preface. See 1.40, 1.41, 1.43, 1.47.\n\nforgo. See forego.\n\nformer; latter. In the best usage, these words apply only to pairs. The former is the first of two, the latter the second of two.\n\nfortuitous; fortunate. Fortuitous means \u201chappening by chance,\u201d usually (but not always) with a good result {the rotten tree could have fallen at any time; it was just fortuitous that the victims drove by when they did}. Fortunate means \u201clucky\u201d {we were fortunate to win the raffle}. Today, unfortunately, fortuitous is poaching on the semantic turf of fortunate.\n\nforward(s). See toward.\n\nfounder. See flounder.\n\nfree rein. So written\u2014not free reign.\n\nfulsome, adj. This word does not preferably mean \u201cvery full\u201d but \u201ctoo much, excessive to the point of being repulsive.\u201d Traditionally, a \u201cfulsome speech\u201d is one that is so overpacked with thanks or hyperbole as to sound insincere. The word\u2019s slipshod use arises most often in the clich\u00e9 fulsome praise, which can suggest the opposite of what the writer probably intends.\n\nfurther. See farther.\n\nfuture, in the near. Use soon or shortly instead.\n\ngauntlet; gantlet. Lexicographers and usage critics\u2014especially American ones\u2014have sought since the nineteenth century to make a distinction. Etymologically, the two words have different histories: throwing down the gauntlet (= glove) and running the gantlope (= ordeal). But gauntlet has taken over both meanings. The standard phrases have been run the gauntlet and throw down the gauntlet since about 1800\u2014the former phrase by a 10-to-1 margin over the competing form run the gantlet. Efforts to separate the terms have run their grueling course.\n\ngentleman. This word is a vulgarism when used as a synonym for man. When used in reference to a cultured, refined man, it is susceptible to some of the same objections as those leveled against lady. Use it cautiously. Cf. lady.\n\nget. Though shunned by many writers as too casual, get often sounds more natural than obtain or procure {get a divorce}. It can also substitute for a stuffy become {get hurt}. The verb is conjugated get\u2013got\u2013gotten in American English and get\u2013got\u2013got in British English. Get is the only verb apart from be-verbs that, when coupled with a past participle, can create a passive-voice construction {get stolen} {get waylaid}.\n\ngibe; jibe; jive. A gibe is a biting insult or taunt: gibes are figuratively thrown at their target {the angry crowd hurled gibes at the miscreant}. To jibe is to be in accord or to agree {the verdict didn\u2019t jibe with the judge\u2019s own view of the facts}. Jive can be either a noun (referring to swing music or to misleading talk that is transparently untrue) or a verb (meaning \u201cto dance to such music\u201d or \u201cto try to mislead with lies\u201d).\n\ngild. See guild.\n\ngo. This verb is conjugated go\u2013went\u2013gone. Went appears as a past participle only in dialect.\n\ngourmet; gourmand. Both are aficionados of good food and drink. But a gourmet knows and appreciates the fine points of food and drink, whereas a gourmand tends toward gluttony.\n\ngraduate, vb. Whereas graduate means \u201cto grant a diploma to or confer a degree on,\u201d graduate from means \u201cto receive a diploma or degree from (a school, university, or other institution).\u201d A school can graduate a student or a student can graduate from a school, but a student does not graduate a school\u2014at least not in good usage.\n\ngrateful; gratified. To be grateful is to be thankful or appreciative. To be gratified is to be pleased, satisfied, or indulged.\n\ngrisly; grizzly. What is grisly is gruesome or horrible {grisly details}. What is grizzly is grayish {grizzly hair} or bearish {the North American grizzly bear}.\n\nguild, n.; gild, vb. A guild is an organization of persons with a common interest or profession {a guild of goldsmiths}. To gild is to put a thin layer of gold on something {gild a picture frame}, sometimes in a figurative sense {gilding the lily}.\n\nhail; hale. To hail is to salute or greet {hail, Caesar!}, to acclaim enthusiastically {hailed as the greatest novelist of her time}, or to shout as an attention-getter {hail a taxi}. To hale is to compel to go {haled into court}. Hail is also a noun denoting ice-pellet precipitation, or something like it {a hail of insults}. Hale is also an adjective describing someone who is physically sound and free from infirmities.\n\nhalf (of). Delete the of whenever possible {half the furniture}. When half is followed by a singular noun, the verb is singular {half the state is solidly Democratic}; when it is followed by a plural noun, the verb is plural {half the people are Republicans}.\n\nhandful. If handful applies to a mass noun, use a singular verb {a handful of trouble is ahead}. But if handful applies to a plural count noun, use a plural verb {only a handful of walnut trees still line Main Street}.\n\nhangar; hanger. One finds hangars (large buildings where aircraft are kept) at an airport {airplane hangars}. Everywhere else, one finds hangers {clothes hangers} {picture hangers}.\n\nhanged; hung. Hanged is used as the past participle of hang only in its transitive form when referring to the killing (just or unjust) of a human being by suspending the person by the neck {criminals were hanged at Tyburn Hill}. But if death is not intended or likely, or if the person is suspended by a body part other than the neck, hung is correct {he was hung upside down as a cruel prank}. In most senses, of course, hung is the past form of hang {Abdul hung up his clothes}.\n\nhanger. See hangar.\n\nharass; embarrass. The first word has one r; the second has two. The pronunciation of harass also causes confusion. The dominant American pronunciation stresses the second syllable, while British English stresses the first.\n\nharebrained. So spelled (after the timid, easily startled animal)\u2014not hairbrained.\n\nhark back. So written\u2014preferably not harken back or hearken back.\n\nhealthy; healthful. Traditionally, a living thing that is healthy enjoys good health; something that is healthful promotes health {a healthful diet will keep you healthy}. But gradually healthy is taking over both senses.\n\nhelp (to). Omit the to when possible {talking will help resolve the problem}.\n\nhe or she. To avoid sexist language, many writers use this alternative phrasing (in place of the generic he). Use it sparingly\u2014preferably after exhausting all other, less obtrusive methods of achieving gender neutrality. In any event, he or she is much preferable to he\/she, s\/he, (s)he, and the like. See also 5.48, 5.255.\n\nhistoric; historical. The shorter word refers to what is momentous in history {January 16, 1991, was a historic day in Kuwait}. Historical, meanwhile, refers simply to anything that pertains to or occurred in history {the historical record}. On the question whether to use a or an before historic and historical, see a.\n\nhoard; horde. A hoard is a supply, usually secret and sometimes valuable. Hoard is also a verb meaning \u201cto amass such a supply,\u201d especially when there is no need to do so. A horde was originally a tribe of Asian nomads; today a horde is a large crowd, especially one that moves in a noisy, uncontrolled way.\n\nhoi polloi. This is a mildly disparaging phrase for \u201ccommon people.\u201d It does not refer to elites, though some writers and speakers misuse it in this way (perhaps from false association with hoity-toity). It is a plural. Although hoi is Greek for \u201cthe,\u201d the phrase is commonly rendered the hoi polloi and has been at least since it was used by John Dryden in 1668.\n\nholocaust. When capitalized, this word refers to the Nazi genocide of European Jews in World War II. When not capitalized, it refers (literally or figuratively) to extensive devastation caused by fire or to the systematic and malicious killings of human beings on a vast scale. Avoid any light or hyperbolic use of this word.\n\nhome in. This phrase is frequently misrendered hone in. (Hone means \u201cto sharpen.\u201d) Home in refers to what homing pigeons and aerial bombs do; the meaning is \u201cto come closer and closer to a target.\u201d\n\nhomicide. See murder.\n\nhopefully. The old meaning of the word (\u201cin a hopeful manner\u201d) seems unsustainable; the newer meaning (\u201cI hope\u201d or \u201cit is to be hoped that\u201d), as a sentence adverb, spread in the 1960s and 1970s and seems here to stay. But many careful writers still deplore the new meaning.\n\nhorde. See hoard.\n\nhumanitarian. This word means \u201cinvolving the promotion of human welfare\u201d {humanitarian philanthropy}. Avoid using it in a phrase such as the worst humanitarian disaster in decades, where it really means just \u201chuman.\u201d\n\nhung. See hanged.\n\nI; me. When you need a first-person pronoun, use one. It\u2019s not immodest to do so; it\u2019s superstitious not to. But be sure you get the right one {Sally and I are planning to go} {give John or me a call} {keep this between you and me}. See between you and me.\n\nidyllic. An idyll is a short pastoral poem, and by extension idyllic means charming or picturesque. It is not synonymous with ideal (perfect).\n\ni.e.; e.g. The first is the abbreviation for id est (\u201cthat is\u201d); the second is the abbreviation for exempli gratia (\u201cfor example\u201d). The English equivalents are preferable in formal prose, though sometimes the compactness of these two-character abbreviations makes them desirable. Always put a comma after either one. See also 6.20, 6.51.\n\nif; whether. While if is conditional, whether introduces an alternative, often in the context of an indirect question. Use whether in two circumstances: (1)\u00a0to introduce a noun clause: he asked whether his tie was straight (the alternatives are yes and no), and (2)\u00a0when using if produces ambiguity. In the sentence he asked if his tie was straight, the literal meaning is \u201cwhenever his tie was straight, he asked\u201d; the popular meaning \u201che wanted someone to tell him whether his tie did or didn\u2019t need straightening\u201d may not be understood by all readers. More tellingly, Call to let me know if you can come means that you should call only if you\u2019re coming. Call to let me know whether you can come means that you should call regardless of whether the answer is yes or no. Avoid substituting if for whether unless your tone is intentionally informal or you are quoting someone. See determine whether; whether.\n\nilk. This noun commonly means \u201ctype\u201d or \u201csort\u201d in modern usage, and unobjectionably so today {of his ilk} {of that ilk}. The Scottish phrase of that ilk means \u201cof the same name or place.\u201d\n\nillegal. See unlawful.\n\nillegible; unreadable. Handwriting or printing that is illegible is not clear enough to be read {illegible scrawlings}. Writing that is unreadable is so poorly composed as to be either incomprehensible or intolerably dull.\n\nillicit. See elicit; unlawful.\n\nillude. See allude.\n\nimmigrate; emigrate. To immigrate is to enter a country to live permanently, leaving a past home. To emigrate is to leave one country to live in another one. The cognate forms also demand attention. Someone who moves from Ireland to the United States is an immigrant here and an emigrant there. An \u00e9migr\u00e9 is also an emigrant, but especially one in political exile.\n\nimminent. See eminent.\n\nimpact; impactful. Resist using impact as a verb. Try affect or influence instead. Besides being hyperbolic, impact is still considered a solecism by traditionalists (though it is gaining ground). Avoid impactful, which is jargon (replacements include influential and powerful). Cf. access.\n\nimpeachment. Impeachment is the legislative equivalent of an indictment, not a conviction. In the US federal system, the House of Representatives votes on impeachment, and the Senate votes on removal from office.\n\nimpelled. See compelled.\n\nimplicit. See explicit.\n\nimply; infer. The writer or speaker implies (hints, suggests); the reader or listener infers (deduces). Writers and speakers often use infer as if it were synonymous with imply, but careful writers always distinguish between the two words. See inference.\n\nimportant; importantly. In the phrase more important(ly)\u2014usually at the outset of a sentence\u2014traditionalists prefer the shorter form as an ellipsis of what is more important, normally with a comma following. But more importantly is now established as a sentence adverb\u2014and it\u2019s unobjectionable.\n\nimpractical; impracticable. The first is the more general adjective, meaning \u201cnot sensible\u201d or \u201cunrealistic\u201d {impractical planning that doesn\u2019t account for travel expenses}. The second means \u201cimpossible to carry out\u201d {landing aircraft on that hole-ridden runway proved impracticable}. See also practicable.\n\nin actual fact. See actual fact, in.\n\ninasmuch as. Because or since is almost always a better choice. See since.\n\nin behalf of. See behalf.\n\nincidence; incident; instance. Be careful with the first of these words: it has to do with relative rates and ranges {the incidence of albinism within a given society}. Perhaps leave it to scientists and actuaries. An incident (= an event, occurrence, or happening) should be distinguished from an instance (= a case, example).\n\ninclude; comprise. The basic difference between these near-synonyms is that include implies nonexclusivity {the collection includes 126 portraits [suggesting that there is much else in the collection]}, while comprise implies exclusivity {the collection comprises 126 silver spoons [suggesting that nothing else is part of the collection]}. Oddly, in patent law\u2014and there alone\u2014comprise carries a nonexclusive sense. See comprise.\n\nin connection with. This is a vague, fuzzy phrase {she explained the financial consequences in connection with the transaction} {Ray liked everything in connection with golf} {Phipson was compensated in connection with its report}. Try replacing the phrase with of, related to, or associated with {she explained the financial consequences of the transaction}, about {Ray liked everything about golf}, or for {Phipson was compensated for its report}.\n\nincredible; incredulous. Incredible properly means \u201ctoo strange to be believed; difficult to believe.\u201d Colloquially, it is used to mean \u201castonishingly good\u201d {it was an incredible trip}. Incredulous means \u201cdisbelieving, skeptical\u201d {people are incredulous about the rising gas costs}.\n\ninculcate; indoctrinate. One inculcates values into a child but indoctrinates the child with values. That is, inculcate always takes the preposition into and a value or values as its object {inculcate courage into soldiers}. Indoctrinate takes a person as its object {indoctrinate children with the habit of telling the truth}.\n\nindividual. Use this word to distinguish a single person from a group. When possible, use a more specific term, such as person, adult, child, man, or woman.\n\nindoctrinate. See inculcate.\n\ninduce. See adduce.\n\nin excess of. Try replacing this verbose phrase with more than or over. See over.\n\ninfectious. See contagious.\n\ninfer. See imply.\n\ninference. Use the verb draw, not make, with inference {they drew the wrong inferences}. Otherwise readers may confuse inference with implication. See imply.\n\ninflammable. See flammable.\n\ninflict; afflict. Events, illnesses, punishments, etc. are inflicted on living things or entities {an abuser inflicts cruelty}. The sufferers are afflicted with or by disease, troubles, etc. {agricultural communities are afflicted with drought}.\n\ningenious; ingenuous. These words are similar in form but not in meaning. Ingenious describes what is intelligent, clever, and original {an ingenious invention}. Ingenuous describes a person who is candid, naive, and without dissimulation, or an action or statement with those qualities {a hurtful but ingenuous observation}.\n\ninnate; inherent. An innate characteristic is one that a living thing has from birth; it should be distinguished, then, from a talent or disposition that one acquires from training or experience. An inherent characteristic is also part of a thing\u2019s nature, but life is not implied. A rock, for example, has an inherent hardness.\n\ninnervate. See enervate.\n\ninnocent; not guilty. If you are innocent, you are without blame. If you are not guilty, you have been exonerated by a jury. Newspapers avoid the not guilty phrase, though, because the consequences of accidentally leaving off the not could be serious. See pleaded.\n\ninnumerable. See enumerable.\n\nin order to; in order for. Often these expressions can be reduced to to and for. When that is so, and rhythm and euphony are preserved or even heightened, use to or for.\n\nin proximity. See close proximity.\n\ninquire. The normal spellings in American English and British English alike are inquire and inquiry. Enquire and enquiry are primarily British English variants.\n\nin regard to. This is the phrase, not the nonstandard in regards to. But try a single-word substitute instead: about, regarding, concerning, etc.\n\ninsidious; invidious. What is insidious spreads gradually to cause damage\u2014at first without being noticed {an insidious conspiracy}; what is invidious involves moral offensiveness and serious unpleasantness {invidious discrimination}.\n\nin spite of. See despite.\n\ninstance. See incidence.\n\ninsure. See ensure.\n\nintense; intensive. Intense means (1)\u00a0\u201chaving a strong effect\u201d {intense pressures}, (2)\u00a0\u201cinvolving a great deal of effort during a very short time\u201d {intense concentration}, or (3)\u00a0\u201chaving unduly strong feelings or a demeanor of exaggerated seriousness\u201d {he\u2019s a bit too intense}. Intense is always preferred outside philosophical and scientific usages. But intensive should be retained in customary terms such as labor-intensive and intensive care.\n\nintently; intensely. An act done intently is done purposefully and with concentration and determination. One that is done intensely is done with great power, passion, or emotion but not necessarily with deliberate intent.\n\ninter; intern. Inter is a verb meaning \u201cto bury (a dead person)\u201d; the corresponding noun is interment. An intern is a student working temporarily to gain experience, especially in a profession. Intern is also a verb with two senses. As an intransitive verb, it means \u201cto work as an intern\u201d {interning at the US Senate}; the corresponding noun is internship. As a transitive verb, it means \u201cto confine (a civilian) to a certain place or district without a criminal charge, especially in wartime or for political reasons\u201d; the corresponding noun is internment.\n\nin the affirmative. See affirmative, in the.\n\nin the event that. See event.\n\nin the near future. See future, in the near.\n\nin the negative. See affirmative, in the.\n\ninveigh; inveigle. To inveigh is to protest, usually against something {picketers inveighed against annexation}. To inveigle is to cajole or ensnare, especially by misleading {inveigling a friend to attend the party}.\n\ninvidious. See insidious.\n\ninvoke. See evoke.\n\nirregardless. An error. Use regardless (or possibly irrespective).\n\nit is I; it is me. Both are correct and acceptable. The first phrase, using the first-person predicate nominative, is strictly grammatical (and a little stuffy); the second is idiomatic (and relaxed), and it is often contracted to it\u2019s me. In third-person constructions, however, a greater stringency holds sway in good English {this is he} {it isn\u2019t she who has caused such misery}.\n\nits; it\u2019s. Its is the possessive form of it; it\u2019s is the contraction for it is {it\u2019s a sad dog that scratches its fleas}.\n\njealousy; envy. Jealousy connotes feelings of resentment toward another, particularly in matters relating to an intimate relationship {sexual jealousy}. Envy refers to coveting another\u2019s advantages, possessions, or abilities {his transparent envy of others\u2019 successes}.\n\njibe; jive. See gibe.\n\nkarat. See carat.\n\nkudos. Preferably pronounced \/k[y]oo-dos\/ (not \/-dohz\/), this word means \u201cpraise and admiration.\u201d It is singular, not plural. Hence avoid kudo is or kudos are.\n\nlady. When used as a synonym for woman\u2014indeed, when used anywhere but in the phrase ladies and gentlemen\u2014this word will be considered objectionable by some readers who think that it refers to a patronizing stereotype. This is especially true when it is used for unprestigious jobs {cleaning lady} or as a condescending adjective {lady lawyer}. Some will insist on using it to describe a refined woman. If they\u2019ve consulted this entry, they\u2019ve been forewarned. Cf. gentleman.\n\nlast; lastly. As with first, second, etc., prefer last when introducing a final point of discussion\u2014or (of course) finally.\n\nlatter. See former.\n\nlaudable; laudatory. Laudable means \u201cpraiseworthy, even if not fully successful\u201d {a laudable effort}. Laudatory means \u201cexpressing praise\u201d {laudatory phone calls}.\n\nlay; lie. Admittedly, the traditional conjugations are more blurred than ever. Mastering them has proved difficult for people. Nevertheless, here goes. Lay is a transitive verb\u2014that is, it demands a direct object {lay your pencils down}. It is inflected lay\u2013laid\u2013laid {I laid the book there yesterday} {these rumors have been laid to rest}. (The children\u2019s prayer Now I lay me down to sleep is a good mnemonic device for the transitive lay.) Lie is an intransitive verb\u2014that is, it never takes a direct object {lie down and rest}. It is inflected lie\u2013lay\u2013lain {she lay down and rested} {he hasn\u2019t yet lain down in twenty-three hours}. In a doctor\u2019s office, you should be asked to lie back or lie down.\n\nleach; leech. To leach is to percolate or to separate out solids in solution by percolation. A leech is a bloodsucker (whether literal or figurative). By extension of that noun, to leech is either to attach oneself to another as a leech does or to drain the resources of something.\n\nlead. See led.\n\nlease; let. Many Americans seem to think that let is colloquial and of modern origin. In fact, the word is three hundred years older than lease and just as proper. One distinction between the two words is that either the owner or the tenant can be said to lease property, but only the owner can be said to let it.\n\nled. This is the correct spelling of the past tense and past participle of the verb lead. It is often misspelled lead, maybe in part because of the pronunciation of the metal lead and the past tense and past participle read, both of which rhyme with led.\n\nleech. See leach.\n\nlend, vb.; loan, vb. & n. Lend is the correct term for letting someone use something with the understanding that it (or its equivalent) will be returned. The verb loan is standard especially when money is the subject of the transaction\u2014but even then, lend appears somewhat more frequently in edited English. Loan is the noun corresponding to both lend and loan, vb. The past-tense and past-participial form of lend is lent.\n\nless; fewer. Reserve less for singular mass nouns or amounts {less salt} {less soil} {less water}. Reserve fewer for plural count nouns {fewer calories} {fewer people} {fewer suggestions}.\n\nlest. This is one of the few English words that invariably call for a verb in the subjunctive mood {he didn\u2019t want to drive lest he take a wrong turn} {he has turned down the volume lest he disturb his roommates}. The conjunction is somewhat more common in British English than in American English.\n\nlet. See lease.\n\nlibel. See defamation.\n\nlie. See lay.\n\nlife-and-death; life-or-death. The problem of logic aside (life and death being mutually exclusive), the first phrase is the standard idiom {a life-and-death decision}.\n\nlight, vb. This verb can be inflected either light\u2013lit\u2013lit or light\u2013lighted\u2013lighted\u2014and irreproachably so. The past-participial adjective tends to be lighted when not modified by an -ly adverb {a lighted building} {a well-lighted hall} but lit if an -ly adverb precedes {brightly lit sconces} {a nicely lit walkway}.\n\nlike; as. The use of like as a conjunction (as in the old jingle \u201ctastes good like a cigarette should\u201d) has long been a contentious issue. Traditionally speaking, like is a preposition, not a conjunction equivalent to as {you\u2019re much like me [me is the object of the preposition like]} {do as I say [the conjunction as connects the imperative do with the independent clause I say]}. As a casualism, however, the conjunctive like has become especially common since the mid-twentieth century {nobody cares like I do} {it tastes good like a fine chocolate should}. In Standard Written English, a conjunctive like will still provoke frowns among some readers. But the objections are slowly dwindling. If you want your prose to be unimpeachable and heightened, stick to as and as if for conjunctive senses {as we\u2019ve observed, man is a social animal} {it looks as if it might rain}. See also 5.185.\n\nlikely. See apt.\n\nliterally. This word means \u201cactually; without exaggeration.\u201d It should not be used loosely in figurative senses, as in they were literally glued to their seats (unless glue had in fact been applied). Wherever guides have accepted this usage, they should be disregarded.\n\nloan. See lend.\n\nloathe, vb.; loath, adj. To loathe (the th pronounced as in that) something is to detest it intensely or to regard it with disgust {I loathe tabloid television}. Someone who is loath (the th pronounced as in thing) is reluctant or unwilling {Tracy seems loath to admit mistakes}.\n\nlose; loose, vb.; loosen. To lose something is to be deprived of it. To loose something is to release it from fastenings or restraints. To loosen is to make less tight or to ease a restraint. Loose conveys the idea of complete release, whereas loosen refers to only a partial release.\n\nlot. See a lot.\n\nluxuriant; luxurious. The two terms are fairly often confused (an example of catachresis). What is luxuriant is lush and grows abundantly {a luxuriant head of hair}. What is luxurious is lavish, extravagant, and comfortable {a luxurious resort}.\n\nmad; angry. Some people object to using mad to mean \u201cangry\u201d and would reserve it to mean \u201cinsane.\u201d But the first sense dates back seven hundred years and isn\u2019t likely to disappear. As common as it is in everyday use, though, it has been so stigmatized that most people avoid it in formal writing.\n\nmajority. This noun preferably denotes countable things {a majority of votes cast}, not uncountable ones {the majority of the time}. Use most whenever it fits. When referring to a preponderance of votes cast, majority takes a singular verb {her majority was 7 percent}. But referring to a predominant group of people or things, it can take either a singular verb {the majority in the House was soon swept away} or a plural one {the majority of the voters were against the proposal}. Typically, if a genitive with a plural object follows majority, the verb should be plural {a majority of music teachers prefer using the metronome}.\n\nmalevolent; maleficent. Malevolent describes an evil mind that wishes to harm others {with malevolent intent}. Maleficent is similar but describes desire by the miscreant for accomplishing evil {maleficent bullying}.\n\nmalodorous. See odious.\n\nmaltreatment. See mistreatment.\n\nmankind. Consider humankind instead.\n\nmanslaughter. See murder.\n\nmantle; mantel. A mantle is a long, loose garment like a cloak\u2014almost always today being used in a metaphorical sense {assuming the mantle of a martyr}. A mantel is a wood or stone structure around a fireplace {family pictures on the mantel}.\n\nmasterful; masterly. Masterful describes a person who is dominating and imperious. Masterly describes a person who has mastered a craft, trade, or profession, or a product of such mastery; the word often means \u201cauthoritative\u201d {a masterly analysis}. Because masterly does not readily make an adverb (masterlily being extremely awkward), try in a masterly way. See also 5.158.\n\nmay; can. See can.\n\nmay; might. May expresses what is possible, is factual, or could be factual {I may have turned off the stove, but I can\u2019t recall doing it}. Might suggests something that is uncertain, hypothetical, or contrary to fact {I might have won the marathon if I had entered}. See 5.147.\n\nme. See I.\n\nmedal; meddle; metal; mettle. A medal is an award for merit; a metal is a type of substance, usually hard and heavy. To meddle is to interfere. And mettle is a person\u2019s character, courage, and determination to do something no matter how difficult.\n\nmedia; mediums. In scientific contexts and in reference to mass communications, the plural of medium is predominantly media {some bacteria flourish in several types of media} {the media are reporting more medical news}. Although one frequently sees media is, the plural use is recommended. If medium refers to a spiritualist, the plural is mediums {several mediums have held s\u00e9ances here}.\n\nmemoranda; memorandums. Although both plural forms are correct, memoranda has predominated since the early nineteenth century. Don\u2019t use memoranda as if it were singular\u2014the word is memorandum {this memorandum is} {these memoranda are}.\n\nmetal; mettle. See medal.\n\nmete out. The phrase meaning \u201cto distribute\u201d or \u201cto assign\u201d is so spelled {mete out punishment}. Meet out is a common error, especially in the erroneous past tense meeted out.\n\nmight. See may.\n\nmilitate. See mitigate.\n\nminuscule. Something that is minuscule is \u201cvery small.\u201d Probably because of the spelling of the modern word mini (and the prefix of the same spelling, which is recorded only from 1936), it is often misspelled miniscule. In printing, minuscules are lowercase letters and majuscules are capital (uppercase) letters.\n\nmistreatment; maltreatment. Mistreatment is the more general term. Maltreatment denotes a harsh form of mistreatment, involving abuse by rough or cruel handling.\n\nmitigate; militate. To mitigate is to lessen or soften the effects of something unpleasant, harmful, or serious; mitigating circumstances lessen the seriousness of a crime. To militate, by contrast, is to have a marked effect on; the word is usually followed by against {his nearsightedness militated against his ambition to become a commercial pilot}. Avoid the mistaken phrase mitigate against for the correct militate against.\n\nmoot; mute. Moot (\/moot\/) means (traditionally) \u201cdebatable\u201d {a moot point worth our attention} or (by modern extension) \u201chaving no practical significance\u201d {a moot question that is of no account}. Mute (\/m[y]oot\/) means \u201csilent, speechless\u201d\u2014and is often considered offensive when used as a noun {deaf-mute}.\n\nmore than. See over.\n\nmuch; very. Much generally intensifies past-participial adjectives {much obliged} {much encouraged} and some comparatives {much more} {much worse} {much too soon}. Very intensifies adverbs and most adjectives {very carefully} {very bad}, including past-participial adjectives that have more adjectival than verbal force {very bored}. See 5.90.\n\nmurder; manslaughter; homicide. All three words denote the killing of one person by another. Murder and manslaughter are both unlawful killings, but murder is done maliciously and intentionally. Homicide includes killings that are not unlawful, such as by a police officer acting properly in the line of duty. Homicide also refers to a person who kills another.\n\nmute. See moot.\n\nmutual. See common.\n\nmyself. Avoid using myself as a pronoun in place of I or me\u2014a quirk that arises most often after an and or or. Instead, use it reflexively {I did myself a favor} or emphatically {I myself have tried to get through that book!}. See also 5.51.\n\nnaturalist; naturist. Naturalist most often denotes a person who studies natural history, especially a field biologist or an amateur who observes and usually photographs, sketches, or writes about nature. Naturist denotes a nature worshipper or a nudist.\n\nnauseous; nauseated. Whatever is nauseous, traditionally speaking, induces a feeling of nausea\u2014it makes us feel sick to our stomachs. To feel sick is to be nauseated. Although the use of nauseous to mean nauseated may be too common to be called an error anymore, strictly speaking it is poor usage. Because of the ambiguity in nauseous, the wisest course may be to stick to the participial adjectives nauseated and nauseating.\n\nnecessary; necessitous. Necessary means \u201crequired under the circumstances\u201d {the necessary arrangements}. Necessitous means \u201cimpoverished\u201d {living in necessitous circumstances}.\n\nneither. Four points. First, like either, this word when functioning as the subject of a clause takes a singular verb {neither of the subjects was given that medicine}. Second, a neither\u2013nor construction should frame grammatically parallel expressions {neither the room\u2019s being too cold nor the heater\u2019s malfunction could justify his boorish reaction} (both noun elements). Third, a simple neither\u2013nor construction should have only two elements {neither bricks nor stones}\u2014though it\u2019s perfectly permissible to multiply nors for emphasis {neither snow nor rain nor heat nor gloom of night}. Fourth, the word is acceptably pronounced either \/nee-th\u0259r\/ or \/ni-th\u0259r\/.\n\nno. See affirmative, in the.\n\nnoisome. This word has nothing to do with noise. It means noxious, offensive, or foul-smelling {a noisome landfill}.\n\nnone. This word may take either a singular or a plural verb. A guideline: if it is followed by a singular noun, treat it as a singular {none of the building was painted}; if by a plural noun, treat it as a plural {none of the guests were here when I arrived}. But for special emphasis, it is quite proper (though possibly stilted) to use a singular verb when a plural noun follows {none of my suggestions was accepted}.\n\nnonplussed. Traditionally meaning \u201csurprised and confused\u201d {she was nonplussed when he took off the mask}, this word is now frequently misused to mean \u201cunfazed\u201d\u2014almost the opposite of its literal sense. Avoid this newer usage, and avoid the variant spelling nonplused. See faze.\n\nnotable; noticeable; noteworthy. Notable (= readily noticed) applies both to physical things and to qualities {notable sense of humor}. Noticeable means \u201cdetectable with the physical senses\u201d {a noticeable limp}. Noteworthy means \u201cremarkable; deserving attention\u201d {a noteworthy act of kindness}.\n\nnot guilty. See innocent.\n\nnotwithstanding. One word. Less formal alternatives include despite, although, and in spite of. The word notwithstanding may precede or follow a noun {notwithstanding her bad health, she decided to run for office} {her bad health notwithstanding, she decided to run for office}.\n\nnumber. See amount.\n\nobservance; observation. Observance means \u201cobedience to a rule or custom\u201d {the family\u2019s observance of Passover}. Observation means either \u201cthe watching of something\u201d or \u201ca remark based on watching or studying something\u201d {a keen observation about the defense strategy}. Each term is sometimes used when the other would be the better word.\n\nobtain. See attain.\n\nobtuse; abstruse. Obtuse describes a person who can\u2019t understand; abstruse describes an idea that is hard to understand. A person who is obtuse is dull and, by extension, dull-witted. What is abstruse is incomprehensible or nearly so.\n\nodious; odorous; odoriferous; malodorous. Odious means \u201chateful\u201d or \u201cextremely unpleasant\u201d {odious Jim Crow laws}. It is not related to the other terms, but it is sometimes misused as if it were. Odorous means \u201cdetectable by smell (for better or worse)\u201d {odorous gases}. Odoriferous means essentially the same thing: it has meant \u201cfragrant\u201d as often as it has meant \u201cfoul.\u201d Malodorous means \u201csmelling quite bad.\u201d The mistaken form odiferous is often used as a jocular equivalent of smelly\u2014but most dictionaries don\u2019t record it.\n\nof. Avoid using this word needlessly after all, off, inside, and outside. Also, prefer June 2015 over June of 2015. To improve your style, try removing every of-phrase that you reasonably can.\n\noff. Never put of after this word {we got off the bus}.\n\nofficious. A person who is officious is aggressively nosy and meddlesome\u2014and overeager to tell people what to do. The word has nothing to do with officer and should not be confused with official.\n\non; upon. Prefer on to upon unless introducing an event or condition {put that on the shelf, please} {upon the job\u2019s completion, you\u2019ll get paid}. For more about on, see onto.\n\non behalf of. See behalf.\n\none another. See each other.\n\noneself. One word\u2014not one\u2019s self.\n\nonto; on to; on. When is on a preposition, and when an adverb? The sense of the sentence should tell, but the distinction can be subtle. Onto implies a movement, so it has an adverbial flavor even though it is a preposition {the gymnast jumped onto the bars}. When on is part of the verb phrase, it is an adverb and to is the preposition {the gymnast held on to the bars}. One trick is to mentally say \u201cup\u201d before on: if the sentence still makes sense, then onto is probably the right choice {she leaped onto the capstone}. Alone, on does not imply motion {the gymnast is good on the parallel bars}.\n\noppress; repress. Oppress, meaning \u201cto persecute or tyrannize,\u201d is more negative than repress, meaning \u201cto restrain or subordinate.\u201d\n\nor. If this conjunction joins singular nouns functioning as subjects, the verb should be singular {cash or online payment is acceptable}.\n\noral. See verbal.\n\noration. See peroration.\n\nordinance; ordnance. An ordinance is a municipal regulation or an authoritative decree. Ordnance is military armament, especially artillery but also weapons and ammunition generally.\n\norient; orientate. To orient is to get one\u2019s bearings (literally, \u201cto find east\u201d) {it took the new employee a few days to get oriented to the firm\u2019s suite}. Unless used in the sense \u201cto face or turn to the east,\u201d orientate is a poor variation to be avoided.\n\nought; should. Both express a sense of duty, but ought is stronger. Unlike should, ought requires a fully expressed infinitive, even in the negative {you ought not to see the movie}. Don\u2019t omit the to\u2014as many otherwise well-educated speakers and writers have begun doing in recent years. See 5.149, 5.150.\n\noutside. In spatial references, no of is necessary\u2014or desirable\u2014after this word unless it is used as a noun {outside the shop} {the outside of the building}. But outside of is acceptable as a colloquialism meaning \u201cexcept for\u201d or \u201caside from.\u201d\n\nover. As an equivalent of more than, this word is perfectly good idiomatic English.\n\noverly. Avoid this word, which is not considered the best usage. Try over- as a prefix {overprotective} or unduly {unduly protective}.\n\npair. This is a singular form, the plural being pairs {three pairs of shoes}. Yet pair may take either a singular verb {this pair of sunglasses was on the table} or a plural one {the pair were inseparable from the moment they met}.\n\npalette; palate; pallet. An artist\u2019s palette is either the board that an artist uses for mixing colors or (collectively) the colors used by a particular artist or available in a computer program. Your palate is the roof of your mouth specifically or your taste in food generally. A pallet is a low, usually wooden platform for storing and transporting goods in commerce, or a crude bed consisting of a bag filled with straw.\n\npandemic. See epidemic.\n\nparameters. Though it may sound elegant or scientific, this word is usually just pretentious when it is used in nontechnical contexts. Stick to boundaries, limits, guidelines, grounds, elements, or some other word.\n\npartake in; partake of. To partake in is to participate in {the new student refused to partake in class discussions}. To partake of is either to get a part of {partake of the banquet} or to have a quality, at least to some extent {this assault partakes of revenge}.\n\npartly; partially. Both words convey the sense \u201cto some extent; in part\u201d {partly responsible}. Partly is preferred in that sense. But partially has the additional senses of \u201cincompletely\u201d {partially cooked} and \u201cunfairly; in a way that shows bias toward one side\u201d {he treats his friends partially}.\n\npast; passed. Past can be an adjective {past events} (often postpositive {times past}), a noun {remember the past}, a preposition {go past the school}, or an adverb {time flew past}. Passed is the past tense and past participle of the verb pass {we passed the school} {as time passed}.\n\npastime. This word combines pass (not past) and time. It is spelled with a single s and a single t.\n\npeaceable; peaceful. A peaceable person or nation is inclined to avoid strife {peaceable kingdom}. A peaceful person, place, or event is serene, tranquil, and calm {a peaceful day free from demands}.\n\npeak; peek; pique. These three sometimes get switched through writerly blunders. A peak is an apex, a peek is a quick or illicit glance, and a fit of pique is an episode of peevishness and wounded vanity. To pique is to annoy or arouse: an article piques (not peaks) one\u2019s interest.\n\npedal; peddle. Pedal is a noun, verb, or adjective relating to the pedal extremity, or foot. As a noun, it denotes a device that is operated by the foot and does some work, such as powering a bicycle or changing the sound of a piano. As a verb, it means to use such a device. As an adjective, it means \u201cof or concerning such a device or its use.\u201d Peddle is a verb meaning either \u201cto try to sell goods to people by traveling from place to place\u201d or \u201cto sell questionable goods to people\u201d\u2014questionable because they may be illegal, harmful, or low quality {peddling magazine subscriptions door to door}.\n\npeek. See peak.\n\npendant, n.; pendent, adj. A pendant is an item of dangling jewelry, especially one worn around the neck. What is pendent is hanging or suspended from something.\n\npenultimate. This adjective means \u201cnext to last\u201d {the penultimate paragraph in the pr\u00e9cis}. Many people have started misusing it as a fancy equivalent of ultimate. The word antepenultimate means \u201cthe next to the next-to-last.\u201d\n\npeople; persons. The traditional view is that persons is used for smaller numbers {three persons} and people with larger ones {millions of people}. But today most people use people even for small groups {only three people were there}.\n\nperoration; oration. A peroration, strictly speaking, is the conclusion of an oration (speech). Careful writers avoid using peroration to refer to a rousing speech or piece of writing.\n\nperpetuate; perpetrate. To perpetuate something is to sustain it or prolong it indefinitely {perpetuate the species}. To perpetrate is to commit or perform an act, especially one that is illegal or morally wrong {perpetrate a crime}.\n\npersonally. Three points. First, use this word only when someone does something that would normally be done through an agent {the president personally signed this invitation} or to limit other considerations {Jean was affected by the decision but was not personally involved in it}. Second, personally is redundant when it modifies a verb that necessarily requires the person\u2019s presence, as in The senator personally shook hands with the constituents. Third, personally shouldn\u2019t appear with I when one is stating an opinion; it weakens the statement and doesn\u2019t reduce the speaker\u2019s liability for the opinion. The only exception arises if a person is required to advance someone else\u2019s view but holds a different personal opinion {in the chamber I voted to lower taxes because of the constituencies I represented; but I personally believed that taxes should have been increased}.\n\npersons. See people.\n\npersuade; convince. Persuade is associated with actions {persuade him to buy a suit}. Convince is associated with beliefs or understandings {she convinced the auditor of her honesty}. The phrase persuade to (do) has traditionally been considered better than convince to (do)\u2014the latter having become common in American English in the 1950s. But either verb will take a that-clause {the committee was persuaded that an all-night session was necessary} {my three-year-old is convinced that Santa Claus exists}.\n\npertain; appertain. Pertain to, the more common term, means \u201cto relate directly to\u201d {the clause pertains to assignment of risk}. Appertain to means \u201cto belong to or concern something as a matter of form or function\u201d {the defendant\u2019s rights appertain to the Fifth Amendment}.\n\nperuse. This term, which means \u201cto read with great care\u201d (not \u201cto read quickly\u201d or \u201cto scan\u201d), should not be used as a fancy substitute for read.\n\nphase. See faze.\n\nphenomenon. This is the singular {the phenomenon of texting}, the plural being phenomena {cultural phenomena}.\n\npique. See peak.\n\npitiable; pitiful. To be pitiable is to be worthy of pity. To be pitiful is either to be very poor in quality or to be so sad or unfortunate as to make people feel sympathy.\n\npleaded; pled. The first is the standard past-tense and past-participial form {he pleaded guilty} {they have pleaded with their families}. Avoid pled.\n\nplethora. This noun denotes an excess, surfeit, or overabundance. Avoid it as a mere equivalent of \u201cabundance.\u201d\n\npopulace; populous. The populace is the population of a country as a whole. A populous place is densely populated.\n\npore. To pore over something written is to read it intently {they pored over every word in the report}. Some writers confuse this word with pour.\n\npracticable; possible; practical. These terms differ in shading. What is practicable is capable of being done; it\u2019s feasible. What is possible might be capable of happening or being done, but there is some doubt. What is practical is fit for actual use or in a particular situation. See also impractical.\n\nprecede; proceed. To precede is to happen before or to go before in some sequence, usually time. It also means \u201cto outrank\u201d or \u201cto surpass\u201d in some measure such as importance, but this sense is usually conveyed with the noun precedence {the board\u2019s vote takes precedence over the staff\u2019s recommendation}. The word is often misspelled preceed. To proceed is to go on, whether beginning, continuing, or resuming.\n\nprecipitate, adj.; precipitous. What is precipitate occurs suddenly or rashly, without proper consideration; it describes demands, actions, or movements. What is precipitous is dangerously steep; it describes cliffs and inclines.\n\nprecondition. Try condition or prerequisite instead.\n\npredominant, adj.; predominate, vb. Like dominant, predominant is an adjective {a predominant point of view}. Like dominate, predominate is a verb {a point of view that predominates throughout the state}. Using predominate as an adjective is nonstandard.\n\npreface. See foreword.\n\nprejudice, vb. Although prejudice is a perfectly normal English noun to denote an all-too-common trait, the corresponding verb is a legalism. For a plain-English equivalent, use harm or hurt. But the past-participial adjective prejudiced is perfectly normal in the sense \u201cbiased; harboring strong and often unfair feelings against.\u201d\n\npreliminary to. Make it before, in preparing for, or some other natural phrasing.\n\nprescribe. See proscribe.\n\npresently. This word is ambiguous. Write now or soon, whichever you really mean.\n\npresumption. See assumption.\n\npreventive. Although the corrupt form preventative is fairly common, the strictly correct form is preventive.\n\nprevious to. Make it before.\n\nprinciple; principal. A principle is a natural, moral, or legal rule {the principle of free speech}. The corresponding adjective is principled {a principled decision}. A principal is a person of high authority or prominence {a school principal} or an initial deposit of money {principal and interest}. Principal is also an adjective meaning \u201cmost important.\u201d Hence a principal role is a primary one.\n\nprior to. Make it before or until.\n\nproceed. See precede.\n\nprocess of, in the. You can almost always delete this phrase without affecting the meaning.\n\npropaganda. This is a singular noun denoting information that, being false or misleading, is used by a government or political group to influence people {propaganda was everywhere}. The plural is propagandas.\n\nprophesy; prophecy. Prophesy is the verb meaning \u201cto say what will happen in the future, especially by using supernatural or magical knowledge\u201d {the doomsayers prophesied a market boom despite the bad news}. Prophecy is the noun denoting a prediction, especially one made by someone claiming to have supernatural or magical powers {their prophecies did not materialize}. Prophesize is an erroneous form.\n\nproscribe; prescribe. To proscribe something is to prohibit it {legislation that proscribes drinking while driving}. To prescribe is to say officially what must be done in a particular situation {Henry VIII prescribed the order of succession to include three of his children} or to specify a medical remedy {the doctor prescribed anti-inflammatory pills and certain exercises}.\n\nprotuberance. So spelled. Perhaps because protrude means \u201cto stick out,\u201d writers want to spell protuberance (= something that bulges out) with an extra r (after the t). But the words are from different roots.\n\nproved; proven. Proved is the preferred past participle for the verb prove {it was proved to be true}. Use proven only as an adjective {a proven success}.\n\nproximity. See close proximity.\n\npurposely; purposefully. What is done purposely is done deliberately or intentionally\u2014\u201con purpose.\u201d What is done purposefully is done with a certain goal or a clear aim in mind. An action may be done purposely without any particular interest in a specific result\u2014that is, not purposefully.\n\nquestion whether; question of whether; question as to whether. The first phrasing is traditionally considered best. The others are phraseologically inferior. See as to.\n\nquick(ly). Quickly is the general adverb. But quick is properly used as an adverb in the idiomatic phrases get rich quick and come quick. See also 5.160.\n\nquote; quotation. Traditionally a verb, quote is often used as an equivalent of quotation in speech and informal writing. Also, there is a tendency for writers (especially journalists) to think of quotes as contemporary remarks usable in their writing and of quotations as being wisdom of the ages expressed pithily.\n\nrack; wrack. The spelling rack is complex: it accounts for nine different nouns and seven different verbs. Indeed, it is standard in all familiar senses {racking his brain} {racked with guilt} {nerve-racking} {rack and ruin}. Wrack is the standard spelling only for the noun meaning \u201cseaweed, kelp.\u201d\n\nraise; raze. To raise is to elevate, move upward, enhance, bring up, etc. {we raised some money}. To raze is to demolish, level to the ground, remove, etc. {they razed the building}.\n\nreason. Two points. First, as to reason why, although some object to the supposed redundancy of this phrase, it is centuries old and perfectly acceptable English. Reason that is not always an adequate substitute {can you give reasons why that is preferable to which as a restrictive relative pronoun?}. Second, reason\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. is because is not good usage\u2014reason\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. is that being preferred {the reason we returned on July 2 is that we wanted to avoid hordes of tourists}.\n\nrecur; reoccur. To recur is to happen again and again {his knee problems recurred throughout the rest of the year}, to return to in one\u2019s attention or memory {she recurred to her war experiences throughout our visit}, or to come back to one\u2019s attention or memory {the idea recurred to him throughout the night}. To reoccur is merely to happen again {the leak reoccurred during the second big rain}.\n\nreek. See wreak.\n\nreference; referral. A reference is a source of information, a person to provide information, an authority for some assertion, or a strong allusion to something. It\u2019s also an attributive adjective {reference book}. It\u2019s not universally accepted as a transitive verb. Referral is a narrower term denoting the practice or an instance of (1)\u00a0directing someone to another person who can help, especially a professional or a specialist, or (2)\u00a0relegating some matter to another body for a recommendation or resolution.\n\nrefrain; restrain. To refrain is to restrain yourself or to keep from doing something; it is typically an act of self-discipline. Other people restrain you by stopping you from doing something, especially by using physical force {if you don\u2019t refrain from the disorderly conduct, the police will restrain you}. Yet it is possible to restrain oneself by controlling one\u2019s own emotions or behavior\u2014and doing so is known as self-restraint.\n\nrefute, vb. To refute is to prove that a statement or an idea is wrong\u2014not merely to deny or rebut.\n\nregardless. See irregardless.\n\nregrettable; regretful. What is regrettable is unfortunate or unpleasant enough to make one wish that things were otherwise. A person who is regretful feels sorry or disappointed about something done or lost. The adverb regrettably, not regretfully, is the synonym of unfortunately.\n\nrein; reign. A rein (usually plural) controls a horse; it is the right word in idioms such as take the reins, give free rein, and, as a verb, rein in. A reign is a state of or term of dominion, especially that of a monarch but by extension also dominance in some field. This is the right word in idioms such as reign of terror and, as a verb, reign supreme.\n\nrelegate; delegate. To relegate is to assign a lesser position than before {the officer was relegated to desk duty pending an investigation}. To delegate is to authorize a subordinate to act in one\u2019s behalf {Congress delegated environmental regulation to the EPA} or to choose someone to do a particular job or to represent an organization or group {she was delegated to find a suitable hotel for the event}.\n\nreluctant. See reticent.\n\nrenounce. See denounce.\n\nreoccur. See recur.\n\nrepellent; repulsive. Repellent and repulsive both denote the character of driving others away. But repulsive has strong connotations of being so disgusting as to make one feel sick.\n\nrepetitive; repetitious. Both mean \u201coccurring over and over.\u201d But whereas repetitive is fairly neutral in connotation, repetitious has taken on the nuance of tediousness that induces boredom.\n\nrepress. See oppress.\n\nrepulsive. See repellent.\n\nrestive; restful. Restive means \u201cso dissatisfied or bored with a situation as to be impatient for change.\u201d Restful means \u201cpeaceful, quiet, and conducive to relaxation.\u201d\n\nrestrain. See refrain.\n\nreticent. Avoid using this word as a synonym for reluctant. It means \u201cunwilling to talk about what one feels or knows; taciturn\u201d {when asked about the incident, the congressional representative became uncharacteristically reticent}.\n\nrevenge. See avenge.\n\nrob; steal. Both verbs mean \u201cto wrongfully take [something from another person].\u201d But rob also includes a threat or act of harming, usually but not always to the person being robbed.\n\nrole; roll. A role is an acting part {the role of Hamlet} or the way in which someone or something is involved in an activity or situation, especially in reference to influence {the role that money plays as an incentive}. Roll has many meanings, including a roster {guest roll}; something made or done by rolling {roll of the dice}; and something in the shape of a cylinder or sphere, whether literally {dinner roll} or figuratively {bankroll}. Roll can also be a verb meaning to rotate {roll over!}, to wrap [something] {roll up the leftovers}, or to move forward {the cart rolled down the hill}.\n\nrun the gauntlet. See gauntlet.\n\nsacrilegious. This is the correct spelling. There is a tendency by some to switch the i and e on either side of the l, but in fact the word is related to sacrilege, not religion or religious.\n\nseasonal; seasonable. Seasonal means either \u201chappening as expected or needed during a particular time of year\u201d {snow skiing is a seasonal hobby} or \u201crelating to the seasons or a season\u201d {the seasonal aisle stays stocked most of the year, starting with Valentine\u2019s Day gifts in January}. Seasonable means \u201ctimely\u201d {seasonable motions for continuance} or \u201cfitting the time of year\u201d {it was unseasonably cold for July}.\n\nself-deprecating. See deprecate.\n\nsemi-. See bi-.\n\nsemiannual. See biannual.\n\nsensor. See censer.\n\nsensual; sensuous. What is sensual involves indulgence of the physical senses\u2014especially sexual gratification. What is sensuous usually applies to aesthetic enjoyment; it is primarily hack writers who imbue the word with salacious connotations.\n\nsewer; sewage; sewerage. Sewer denotes a wastewater pipe or passage. Sewage denotes the waste carried through such a pipe or passage. Sewerage denotes the sewer system as a whole, including treatment plants and other facilities, and the function of the disposal of sewage and wastewater in general.\n\nshall. This word is complicated. The reality is that shall is little used in everyday contexts outside British English\u2014not in North America but also not in Australia, Ireland, or Scotland. In legal contexts, it frequently appears in statutes, rules, and contracts, supposedly in a mandatory sense but actually quite ambiguously. It is perhaps the most widely litigated word in the law\u2014with wildly varying results in its multifarious interpretations. Legal drafters are therefore often advised to avoid it altogether in favor of must, is, will, may, and other words or phrases among which shall\u2019s various meanings can be allocated.8 See also 5.131.\n\nshear; sheer. Shear is the noun or verb relating to (1)\u00a0the cutting tool or (2)\u00a0a force affecting movement, such as a crosswind or the slipping of plates in an earthquake. Sheer is most often an adjective meaning (1)\u00a0\u201csemitransparent\u201d {a sheer curtain}, (2)\u00a0\u201cnothing but\u201d {sheer madness}, or (3)\u00a0\u201calmost vertical\u201d {a sheer cliff}.\n\nshine. When this verb is intransitive, it means \u201cto give or make light\u201d; the past tense is shone {the stars shone dimly}. When it is transitive, it means \u201cto cause to shine\u201d; the past tense is shined {the caterer shined the silver}.\n\nshould. See ought.\n\nsight; site. A sight may be something worth seeing {the sights of London} or a device to aid the eye {the sight of a gun}, among other things. A site is a place, whether physical {a mall will be built on this site} or electronic {website}. The figurative expression meaning \u201cto focus on a goal\u201d is to set one\u2019s sights. Cf. cite.\n\nsimplistic. This word, meaning \u201coversimplified,\u201d has derogatory connotations. Don\u2019t confuse it with simple.\n\nsince. This word may relate either to time {since last winter} or to causation {since I\u2019m a golfer, I know what \u201cdouble bogey\u201d means}. Some writers erroneously believe that the word relates exclusively to time. But the causal since was a part of the English language before Chaucer wrote in the fourteenth century, and it is useful as a slightly milder way of expressing causation than because. Still, if there is any possibility of confusion with the temporal sense, use because.\n\nsink. Inflected sink\u2013sank\u2013sunk. Avoid using sunk as a simple past, as in the ship sunk.\n\nsite. See cite; sight.\n\nslander. See defamation.\n\nslew; slough; slue. As a noun, slew (\/sloo\/) is an informal word equivalent to many or lots {you have a slew of cattle}. It is sometimes misspelled slough (a legitimate noun meaning \u201ca grimy swamp,\u201d pronounced either \/sloo\/ or \/slow\/). The phrase slough of despond (from Bunyan\u2019s Pilgrim\u2019s Progress [1678]) means \u201ca state of depression or sadness from which one cannot easily lift oneself.\u201d This term is etymologically different from slough (\/sl\u0259f\/), meaning \u201cto discard\u201d {slough off dry skin}. As a present-tense verb, to slew is to turn or slide violently or suddenly in a different direction\u2014or to make a vehicle do so {the car keeps slewing sideways}. In American English, a variant spelling of this verb is slue. As a past-tense verb, slew corresponds to the present-tense slay {Cain slew Abel}.\n\nslow. This word, like slowly, may be an adverb. Generally, prefer slowly {go slowly}. But in colloquial usage slow is often used after the verb in a pithy statement, especially an injunction {go slow!} {take it slow}. See also 5.160.\n\nslue. See slew.\n\nsneak. This verb is conjugated as a regular verb: sneak\u2013sneaked\u2013sneaked. Reserve snuck for dialect and tongue-in-cheek usages.\n\nspace. As a figurative noun, this word has become a voguish equivalent of area {though not initially interested in journalism, he has decided to move into that space}. Although (or perhaps because) this usage is au courant, avoid it. See also area.\n\nspit. If used to mean \u201cto expectorate,\u201d the verb is inflected spit\u2013spat\u2013spit {he spat a curse} {he has spit many a curse}. But if used to mean \u201cto skewer,\u201d it\u2019s spit\u2013spitted\u2013spitted {the hens have been spitted for broiling}.\n\nstanch. See staunch.\n\nstationary; stationery. Stationary describes a state of immobility or of staying in one place {if it\u2019s stationary, paint it}. Stationery denotes writing materials, especially paper for writing letters, usually with matching envelopes {love letters written on perfumed stationery}. To remember the two, try associating the -er in stationery with the -er in paper; or remember that a stationer is someone who sells the stuff.\n\nstaunch; stanch. Staunch is an adjective meaning \u201cardent and faithful\u201d {a staunch Red Sox supporter}. Stanch is the American English verb meaning \u201cto stop the flow\u201d; it is almost always used in regard to bleeding, literally or metaphorically {after New Hampshire the campaign hemorrhaged; only a big win in South Carolina could stanch the bleeding}. In British English, however, staunching the flow is the standard wording.\n\nsteal. See rob.\n\nstrait; straight. A strait (often pl.) is (1), literally, a narrow channel connecting two large bodies of water separated by two areas of land {Strait of Magellan} or (2), figuratively, a difficult position {dire straits}. This is the word used in compound terms with the sense of constriction {straitlaced} {straitjacket}. Straight is most often an adjective meaning unbent, steady, sober, candid, honest, or heterosexual.\n\nstrata, n. This is the plural for stratum. Keep it plural {Fussell identified nine discrete strata in American society}. Avoid the double plural stratas.\n\nstrategy; tactics. A strategy is a long-term plan for achieving a goal. A tactic is a shorter-term method for achieving an immediate but limited success. A strategy might involve several tactics. By the way, although strategy is so spelled, stratagem has an a in the middle syllable.\n\nsubject. See citizen.\n\nsubsequent. See consequent.\n\nsuch. This word, when used to replace this or that\u2014as in \u201csuch building was later condemned\u201d\u2014is symptomatic of legalese. Such is actually no more precise than the, this, that, these, or those. It\u2019s perfectly acceptable, however, to use such with a mass noun or plural noun when the meaning is \u201cof that type\u201d or \u201cof this kind\u201d {such impudence galled the rest of the family} {such vitriolic exchanges became commonplace in the following years}. See also as such.\n\nsufficient. See adequate.\n\nsupersede. The root of this word derives from sedeo, the Latin word for \u201cto sit, to be established,\u201d not cedo, meaning \u201cto yield.\u201d Hence the spelling varies from the root in words such as concede, recede, and secede. Avoid the variant supercede.\n\nsympathy. See empathy.\n\nsystematic; systemic. Systematic means \u201caccording to a plan or system, organized methodically, or arranged in a system.\u201d Systemic, meaning \u201caffecting the whole of something,\u201d is limited in use to physiological systems {a systemic disease affecting several organs} or, by extension, other systems that may be likened to the body {systemic problems within the corporate hierarchy}.\n\ntactics. See strategy.\n\ntake. See bring.\n\ntantalizing; titillating. A tantalizing thing torments us because we want it badly yet it is always just out of reach. A titillating thing tickles us pleasantly, literally or figuratively, and the word often carries sexual connotations.\n\ntext, vb. Inflected text\u2013texted\u2013texted, as a regular verb. Avoid using the uninflected text for the past-tense forms.\n\nthat; which. These are both relative pronouns (see 5.56\u201366). In polished American prose, that is used restrictively to narrow a category or identify a particular item being talked about {any building that is taller must be outside the state}; which is used nonrestrictively\u2014not to narrow a class or identify a particular item but to add something about an item already identified {alongside the officer trotted a toy poodle, which is hardly a typical police dog}. Which is best used restrictively only when it is preceded by a preposition {the situation in which we find ourselves}. Nonrestrictively, it is almost always preceded by a comma, a parenthesis, or a dash. (In British English, writers and editors seldom observe the distinction between the two words.) Is it a useful distinction? Yes. The language inarguably benefits from having a terminological as well as a punctuational means of telling a restrictive from a nonrestrictive relative pronoun, punctuation often being ill-heeded. Is it acceptable to use that in reference to people? Is friends that arrive early an acceptable alternative to friends who arrive early? The answer is yes. Person that has long been considered good idiomatic English. Even so, person who is nearly three times as common as person that in edited English. See also 6.27.\n\nthere; their; they\u2019re. There denotes a place or direction {stay there}. Their is the possessive pronoun {all their good wishes}. They\u2019re is a contraction of they are {they\u2019re calling now}.\n\ntherefore; therefor. The words have different senses. Therefore, the common word, means \u201cas a result; for that reason\u201d {the evidence of guilt was slight; therefore, the jury acquitted the defendant}. Therefor, a legalism, means \u201cfor it\u201d or \u201cfor them\u201d {he took the unworn shirt back to the store and received a refund therefor}.\n\nthus. This is the adverb\u2014not thusly. Use thus (it\u2019s called a flat adverb). See 5.160.\n\ntill. This is a perfectly good preposition and conjunction {open till 10 p.m.}. It is not a contraction of until and should not be written \u2019til.\n\ntimbre; timber. Timbre is a musical term meaning \u201ctonal quality of the sound made by a particular musical instrument or voice.\u201d Timber is the correct spelling in all other uses, which relate to trees or wood.\n\ntitillating. See tantalizing.\n\ntolerance; toleration. Tolerance is the habitual quality of being tolerant\u2014that is, willing to allow people to say, believe, or do what they want without criticism or punishment. Toleration is a particular instance of being tolerant.\n\n\ntorpid. See turbid.\n\ntortious; tortuous; torturous. What is tortious relates to torts (civil wrongs) or to acts that give rise to legal claims for torts {tortious interference with a contract}. What is tortuous is full of twists and turns and therefore makes travel difficult {a tortuous path through the woods}. What is torturous involves severe physical and mental suffering {a torturous exam}.\n\ntoward; towards. The preferred form in American English is toward: this has been so since about 1900. In British English, towards predominates. The same is true for other directional words, such as upward, downward, forward, and backward, as well as afterward. The use of afterwards and backwards as adverbs is neither rare nor incorrect (and is preferred in British English). For the sake of consistency, many American editors prefer the shorter forms without the final s.\n\ntranscript; transcription. A transcript is either a written record, as of a trial or a radio program, or an official record of a student\u2019s classes and grades. Transcription is the act or process of creating a transcript.\n\ntranspire, vb. Although its traditional sense is \u201cto come to be known\u201d {it transpired that he had paid bribes}, transpire more commonly today means \u201chappen\u201d or \u201coccur\u201d {what transpired when I was away?}. In that newer sense, transpire still carries a vague odor of jargon and pretentiousness. But that is disappearing.\n\ntrillion. See billion.\n\ntriumphal; triumphant. Things are triumphal (done or made to celebrate a victory) {a triumphal arch}. But only people feel triumphant (displaying pleasure and pride as a result of a victory or success) {a triumphant Caesar returned to Rome}.\n\nturbid; turgid; torpid. Turbid water or liquid is thick and opaque from churned-up mud or detritus {a turbid pond}; by extension, turbid means \u201cunclear, confused, or disturbed\u201d {a turbid argument}. Turgid means \u201cswollen,\u201d and by extension \u201cpompous and bombastic\u201d {turgid prose}. Torpid means \u201cidle, lazy, and sleepy\u201d {a torpid economy}.\n\nultimate. See penultimate.\n\nunexceptional; unexceptionable. The first means \u201cnot very good; no better than average.\u201d The second means \u201cnot open to objection.\u201d\n\nuninterested. See disinterested.\n\nunique. Reserve this word for the sense \u201cone of a kind.\u201d Avoid it in the sense \u201cspecial, unusual.\u201d Phrases such as very unique, more unique, somewhat unique, and so on\u2014in which a degree is attributed to unique\u2014aren\u2019t the best usage. See also 5.89.\n\nunlawful; illegal; illicit; criminal. This list is in ascending order of negative connotation. An unlawful act may even be morally innocent (for example, letting a parking meter expire). But an illegal act is something that society formally condemns, and an illicit act calls to mind moral degeneracy {illicit drug use}. Unlike criminal, the first three terms can apply to civil wrongs.\n\nunorganized. See disorganized.\n\nunreadable. See illegible.\n\nupon. See on.\n\nupward(s). See toward.\n\nuse; utilize. Use is usually the best choice for simplicity. Utilize is most often an overblown alternative of use, but it is occasionally the better choice when the distinct sense is \u201cto use to best effect\u201d {how to utilize our staff most effectively}.\n\nvenal; venial. A person who is venal is mercenary or open to bribery\u2014willing to use power and influence dishonestly in return for money {a venal government official}; a thing that is venal is purchasable {venal livestock}. A venial fault or sin is trivial enough to be pardonable or excusable {a venial offense} {a venial error}.\n\nverbal; oral. If something is put into words, it is verbal. Technically, verbal covers both written and spoken utterance. If you wish to specify that something was conveyed through speech, use oral.\n\nvery. See much.\n\nvocation. See avocation.\n\nvoluminous. See compendious.\n\nwaive; wave. To waive is to relinquish claim to or not to insist on enforcing. To wave is to move to and fro.\n\nwangle. See wrangle.\n\nwhether. Generally, use whether alone\u2014not with the words or not tacked on {they didn\u2019t know whether to go}. The or not is necessary only when you mean to convey the idea \u201cregardless of whether\u201d {we\u2019ll finish on time whether or not it rains}. On the distinction between whether and if, see if.\n\nwhich. See that.\n\nwhile. While may substitute for although or whereas, especially if a conversational tone is desired {while many readers may disagree, the scientific community has overwhelmingly adopted the conclusions here presented}. Yet because while can denote either time or contrast, the word is occasionally ambiguous; when a real ambiguity exists, although or whereas is the better choice.\n\nwho; whom. Here are the traditional rules: who is a nominative pronoun used as (1)\u00a0the subject of a finite verb {it was Jim who bought the coffee today} or (2)\u00a0a predicate nominative when it follows a linking verb {that\u2019s who}. Whom is an objective pronoun that may appear as (1)\u00a0the object of a verb {I learned nothing about the man whom I saw} or (2)\u00a0the object of a preposition {the woman to whom I owe my life}. Today there are two countervailing trends: first, there\u2019s a decided tendency to use who colloquially in most contexts; second, among those insecure about their grammar, there\u2019s a tendency to overcorrect oneself and use whom when who would be correct. Writers and editors of formal prose often resist the first of these; everyone should resist the second. See also 5.66.\n\nwhoever; whomever. Avoid the second unless you are certain of your grammar {give this book to whoever wants it} {I cook for whomever I love}. If you are uncertain why these examples are correct, use anyone who or (as in the second example) anyone.\n\nwho\u2019s; whose. The first is a contraction {who\u2019s on first?}, the second a possessive {whose life is it, anyway?}. Unlike who and whom, whose may refer to things as well as people {the Commerce Department, whose bailiwick includes intellectual property}. See 5.64.\n\nworkers\u2019 compensation. This is the preferred name for workplace accident-insurance plans, not workmen\u2019s compensation. Notice that workers is always plural. When used as a phrasal adjective, it is hyphenated {workers\u2019-compensation system}.\n\nwrack. See rack.\n\nwrangle; wangle. To wrangle is to argue, especially angrily over a long period {still wrangling over their parents\u2019 estate}. To wangle is to get something or arrange for something to happen by cleverness, manipulation, or trickery {wangle a couple of last-minute tickets}.\n\nwreak; reek. Wreak means (1)\u00a0\u201cto cause a great deal of harm or many problems\u201d {to wreak havoc on the administration} or (2)\u00a0\u201cto punish someone in revenge\u201d {to wreak vengeance on his erstwhile friends}. The past tense is wreaked, not wrought. (The latter is an archaic form of the past tense and past participle of work.) Reek can be a verb meaning \u201cto stink\u201d or a noun meaning \u201cstench.\u201d\n\nwrong; wrongful. These terms are not interchangeable. Wrong has two senses: (1)\u00a0\u201cimmoral, unlawful\u201d {it\u2019s wrong to bully smaller children} and (2)\u00a0\u201cimproper, incorrect, unsatisfactory\u201d {many of the math answers are wrong}. Wrongful likewise has two senses: (1)\u00a0\u201cunjust, unfair\u201d {wrongful conduct} and (2)\u00a0\u201cunsanctioned by law; having no legal right\u201d {it was a wrongful demand on the estate}.\n\nyes. See affirmative, in the.\n\nyour; you\u2019re. Your is the possessive form of you {your class}. You\u2019re is the contraction for you are {you\u2019re welcome}.\n\n\n\n8.

Nine methods are suggested below because no single method will work for every writer or in every context. Choose the combination of methods that works best in the context you\u2019ve created.\nOmit the pronoun. Sometimes a personal pronoun is not really necessary. For instance, in the programmer should update the records when data is transferred to her by the head office, if there is only one programmer, the pronoun phrase to her can be omitted: the programmer should update the records when data is transferred by the head office. Note that the shorter sentence is tighter as well as gender-free.\nRepeat the noun. If a noun and its pronoun are separated by many words, try repeating the noun. For instance, a writer should be careful not to needlessly antagonize readers, because her credibility would otherwise suffer becomes a writer should be careful not to needlessly antagonize readers, because the writer\u2019s credibility would otherwise suffer. Take care not to overuse this technique. Repeating a noun too frequently will irritate readers. If you have to repeat a noun more than twice in a sentence or repeat it too soon, you should probably rewrite the sentence.\nUse a plural antecedent. By using a plural antecedent, you eliminate the need for a singular pronoun. For instance, a contestant must conduct himself with dignity at all times becomes contestants must conduct themselves with dignity at all times. The method may cause a slight change in connotation. In the example, a duty becomes a collective responsibility rather than an individual one.\nUse an article instead of a pronoun. Try replacing the singular personal pronoun with a definite or indefinite article. Quite often you\u2019ll find that the effect on the sentence\u2019s meaning is negligible. For instance, A student accused of cheating must actively waive his right to have his guidance counselor present becomes A student accused of cheating must actively waive the right to have a guidance counselor present.\nUse the neutral singular pronoun one. Try replacing the gender-specific personal pronoun with the gender-neutral singular pronoun one. For instance, an actor in New York is likely to earn more than he is in Paducah becomes an actor in New York is likely to earn more than one in Paducah.\nUse the relative pronoun who. This technique works best when it replaces a personal pronoun that follows if. It also requires revising the sentence slightly. For instance, employers presume that if an applicant can\u2019t write well, he won\u2019t be a good employee becomes employers presume that an applicant who can\u2019t write well won\u2019t be a good employee.\nUse the imperative mood. The imperative eliminates the need for an explicit pronoun. Although its usefulness is limited in some types of writing, you may find that it avoids prolixity and more forcefully addresses the target audience. For instance, a lifeguard must keep a close watch over children while he is monitoring the pool becomes keep a close watch over children while monitoring the pool.\nIn moderation, use he or she. Although it is an easy fix, the phrase he or she should be used sparingly, preferably only when no other technique is satisfactory. For instance, \u201cabstractitis\u201d is Ernest Gowers\u2019s term for writing that is so abstract and obtuse (hence abstruse) that the writer does not even know what he is trying to say becomes \u201cabstractitis\u201d is Ernest Gowers\u2019s term for writing that is so abstract and obtuse (hence abstruse) that the writer does not even know what he or she is trying to say. If you find you need to repeat the pronouns in the same sentence, don\u2019t. Revise the sentence instead.\nRevise the sentence. If no other technique produces a sentence that reads well, rewrite the sentence so that personal pronouns aren\u2019t needed. The amount of revision will vary. For instance, if a boy or girl misbehaves, his or her privileges will be revoked might become if someone misbehaves, that person\u2019s privileges will be revoked. And a person who decides not to admit he lied will be considered honest until someone exposes his lie might become a person who denies lying will be considered honest until the lie is exposed.\nSee also 5.256."}

Clumsy artifices such as s\/he and (wo)man or artificial genderless pronouns have been tried\u2014for many years\u2014with no success. They won\u2019t succeed. And those who use them invite credibility problems. Indefinite pronouns such as anybody and someone don\u2019t always satisfy the need for a gender-neutral alternative because they are traditionally regarded as singular antecedents that call for a third-person singular pronoun. Many people substitute the plural they and their for the singular he or she. They and their have become common in informal usage, but neither is considered fully acceptable in formal writing, though they are steadily gaining ground. For now, unless you are given guidelines to the contrary, be wary of using these forms in a singular sense. This advice, like the techniques for achieving gender neutrality discussed in 5.255, applies mainly to generic references, where the identity of the person is unknown or unimportant. For references to a specific person, the choice of pronoun may depend on the individual. Some people identify not with a gender-specific pronoun but instead with the pronoun they and its forms or some other gender-neutral singular pronoun; any such preference should generally be respected. See 5.48."}

The word person rarely functions well in such a compound; chairperson and anchorperson sound more pompous and wooden than the simpler (and correct) chair or anchor. Unless a word is established (such as salesperson, which dates from 1901), don\u2019t automatically substitute -person for -man. English has many alternatives that are not necessarily newly coined, including police officer (first recorded in 1797), firefighter (1903), and mail carrier (1788)."}

In general, emphasize the person, not a characteristic. A characteristic is a label. It should preferably be used as an adjective, not as a noun. Instead of referring to someone as, for instance, a Catholic or a deaf-mute, put the person first by writing a Catholic man or he is Catholic, and a deaf-and-mute child or the child is deaf and mute. Avoid irrelevant references to personal characteristics such as sex, race, ethnicity, disability, age, religion, sexual orientation, transgender status, or social standing. Such pointless references may affect a reader\u2019s perception of you or the person you are writing about or both. They may also invoke a reader\u2019s biases and cloud your meaning. When it is important to mention a characteristic because it will help the reader develop a picture of the person you are writing about, use care. For instance, in the sentence Shirley Chisholm was probably the finest African American woman member of the House of Representatives that New York has ever had, the phrase African American woman may imply to some readers that Chisholm was a great representative \u201cfor a woman\u201d but may be surpassed by many or all men, that she stands out only among African American members of Congress, or that it is unusual for a woman or an African American to hold high office. But in Shirley Chisholm was the first African American woman to be elected to Congress and one of New York\u2019s all-time best representatives, the purpose of the phrase African American woman is not likely to be misunderstood."}

In the first example, the period following \u201cline spacing\u201d belongs with the boldface glossary term and is therefore set in bold; the period following \u201cleading\u201d is part of the surrounding sentence and is therefore not set in bold.

In addition, there are a number of spaces with fixed widths, based on the spaces that typesetters have been using for centuries. En spaces and em spaces are wider than the regular space and match the width of en dashes and em dashes in a particular font (see 6.75). Em spaces in particular are sometimes used as a design element, as between a figure number and caption (see 3.23). A thin space or a hair space may be used between contiguous single and double quotation marks (see 6.11). These fixed-width spaces are usually appropriate only in professionally typeset material intended for print or PDF.

For end-of-line word breaks, as for spelling and plural forms, Chicago turns to Webster\u2019s as its primary guide. The dots between syllables in Webster\u2019s indicate where breaks may be made; in words of three or more syllables, there is usually a choice of breaks. The paragraphs in this section are intended merely to supplement, not to replace, the dictionary\u2019s system of word division\u2014for example, by suggesting preferred breaks where more than one might be possible. These recommendations are also intended to serve as a guide for determining appropriate hyphenation settings in page-layout applications. Most such programs automate hyphenation relative to a standard dictionary but allow users to define certain rules (e.g., to specify the minimum number of characters to carry to a new line or the maximum number of consecutive lines that can end in a hyphen) and to make exceptions (e.g., for specific words). For division of non-English words (other than those that are included in an English-language dictionary), see chapter 11.

Names of the systems of thought and references to the adherents to such systems, however, are often lowercased (e.g., \u201can eighteenth-century precursor of socialism\u201d; \u201ca communist at heart\u201d). Nonliteral or metaphorical references are also lowercased (e.g., \u201cfascist parenting techniques\u201d; \u201cnazi tendencies\u201d).

Sometimes the goal of consistency must give way to readability (e.g., at the beginning of a sentence; see 9.5). The guidelines in this chapter apply mainly to general works and to scholarly works in the humanities and social sciences, where numeric quantities are relatively infrequent.

When written, the seven-digit number is conventionally separated by a hyphen; to signal that it may be optional for local calls, the area code is often placed in parentheses. The prefix 1, the same for all numbers (and not always necessary to place a call), can usually be omitted. (Its appearance with toll-free numbers beginning with 800 and the like is customary but not mandatory.) An extension follows the number, separated by a comma.\n\n(000) 000-0000 or (1-000) 000-0000\n(000) 000-0000, ext. 0000\n\nAn alternative style, which recognizes the increasing need to use the area code even for local calls, drops the parentheses. Either style is acceptable, as long as it is used consistently.

A plus symbol, which stands in for the international prefix (e.g., 011 for international calls from the United States or Canada), is placed immediately before the country code (e.g., 52 for Mexico, 66 for Thailand, or 44 for the United Kingdom) with no intervening space. Because their meaning may not be clear, parentheses should not be used for international numbers (e.g., to enclose a national access code that is not needed for international calls).\n\n+52 55 0000 0000 (for a number in Mexico City, Mexico)\n+66 2 000 0000 (for a number in Bangkok, Thailand)\n+44 20 0000 0000 (for a number in London, UK)\n\nnot\n\n+44 (0) 20 0000 0000\n\nIf the international prefix must be expressed, it precedes the country code and is separated from it by a space (e.g., for a call initiated from the United States or Canada, 011 44 20\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0.). A US or Canadian number written for an international audience follows a similar pattern (the country code for both is 1).\n\n+1 607 000 0000 (for a number in New York State)\n\nSpaces or hyphens as separators are the norm within most countries; however, the use of parentheses and number groupings varies widely, not only across countries but also within countries, and for landline versus mobile numbers.

(For the type of contractions normally formed with apostrophes, see 7.30.) These definitions are not perfect. For example, sometimes a letter in an initialism is formed not, as the term might imply, from an initial letter, but rather from its initial sound (as the X in XML, for extensible markup language) or from the application of a number (W3C, for World Wide Web Consortium). Furthermore, an acronym and an initialism are occasionally combined (JPEG), and the line between initialism and acronym is not always clear (FAQ, which can be pronounced either as a word or as a series of letters). In this chapter the umbrella term abbreviation will be used for all three, as well as for shortened (i.e., abbreviated) forms (ibid., vol., prof., etc.), except where greater specificity is required.

A number of expressions are almost always abbreviated, even in regular prose, and may be used without first spelling them out. Many of these will be listed as main entries with pronunciation (labeled as nouns rather than as abbreviations) in the latest edition of Webster\u2019s (e.g., ATM, DIY, DNA, GPS, HMO, HTML, IQ, JPEG, laser, Ms., NASA). Others, though in more or less common use (CGI, FDA, HVAC, MLA), should generally be spelled out at first occurrence\u2014at least in formal text\u2014as a courtesy to those readers who might not easily recognize them. The use of less familiar abbreviations should be limited to terms that occur frequently enough to warrant abbreviation\u2014roughly five times or more within an article or chapter\u2014and the terms must be spelled out on their first occurrence. The abbreviation usually follows immediately, in parentheses, but it may be introduced in other ways (see examples). Such an abbreviation should not be offered only once, never to be used again, except as an alternative form that may be better known to some readers.\n\nAmong recent recommendations of the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) are\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0.\nAccording to the weak law of large numbers (WLLN)\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0.\nThe National Aeronautics and Space Administration was founded in 1958.

In a work with few abbreviations and no list, when an abbreviation reappears after a long interval in which it is not used, it may be helpful to repeat the spelled-out name as a reminder.

(et is not an abbreviation; al. is). An exception may be made for the few academic degrees that end in a lowercase letter (e.g., DLitt, DMin); see 10.21 and rule 3.\nUse periods for initials standing for given names: E.\u00a0B. White; do not use periods for an entire name replaced by initials: JFK.\nUse no periods with abbreviations that include two or more capital letters, even if the abbreviation also includes lowercase letters: VP, CEO, MA, MD, PhD, UK, US, NY, IL (but see rule 4).\nIn publications using traditional state abbreviations, use periods to abbreviate United States and its states and territories: U.S., N.Y., Ill. Note, however, that Chicago recommends using the two-letter postal codes (and therefore US) wherever abbreviations are used; see 10.27. For Canadian provinces and territories, see 10.28. See also 14.274.\nNote that the British and the French (among others) omit periods from contractions (Dr, assn, Mme). Note also that a slash is occasionally used instead of periods (as in c\/o or n\/a) but more often denotes per (see 6.109). Units of measure in nontechnical settings are usually spelled out.

In general, small capitals should be limited to acronyms or initialisms mentioned in running text. Avoid applying small capitals to such items as two-letter postal codes in notes or bibliographies or to roman numerals (e.g., following a personal name). It should be noted that small capitals are not treated in the same way across all software applications and markup systems; small capitals should therefore be checked after conversion for publication to make sure they have not reverted to lowercase or full capitals (see also 2.81\u201383).

Some, such as PC and DVD, are also in wide general use. Abbreviations used in highly specialized areas have generally been omitted, as have most adjectival forms. Many of the abbreviations for units are identical to or compatible with those used in the International System of Units, or SI (see 10.51\u201359). Periods are omitted in any context (compare 10.4). The capitalization given below, based largely on current usage, sometimes departs from that used in Merriam-Webster\u2019s Collegiate Dictionary (see bibliog. 3.1). The first letter of abbreviations derived from proper names (e.g., A [ampere], V, Wb, and the C in \u00b0C) are usually capitalized (though the spelled-out term is lowercased\u2014unless, like Celsius, it forms a unit name with another term, as in \u201cdegree[s] Celsius\u201d), as are the prefix letters for mega- (M), giga- (G), tera- (T), and so on (see 10.56). Plurals do not add an s (10 A, 5 ha). With few exceptions (mainly abbreviations with degree symbols), a space usually appears between a numeral and an abbreviation (22 m but 36\u00b0C); see also 10.58. For units with repeated quantities, see 9.17. For statistical abbreviations, see 10.50. For traditional US units of measure, see 10.64\u201368.

Contrary to general usage, however, SI usage also stipulates a space before a percentage sign (%) or before a degree symbol used for temperature (compare the advice in the introduction to the table at 10.49). In expressions of degrees, minutes, and seconds, SI usage shows (but does not stipulate) a space between quantities.

Each element bears a number (reflecting the number of protons in its nucleus) as well as a name\u2014as in \u201celement 106,\u201d also known as seaborgium. This number is an important identifier in cases where formal names are in dispute; between 1995 and 1997, for example, the American Chemical Society and IUPAC adopted different names for some of the same elements. The differences were reconciled, and the list that follows reflects names and symbols approved by IUPAC. Names for undiscovered or unconfirmed elements are provisionally assigned using Latin for the digits of their atomic number (e.g., ununoctium, one-one-eight, for element 118, which was confirmed in 2015 and named oganesson the following year). The elements in the following list are arranged in alphabetical order by common name. If the symbol is based on a term other than the common name\u2014for example, Sb (stibium) for antimony\u2014the term is added in parentheses. Although the names of elements are always lowercased, the symbols all have an initial capital. No periods are used. In specialized works, the abbreviations commonly appear in text as well as in tables, notes, and so forth.

These guidelines are general: authors or editors working with languages in which they are not expert should seek additional guidance from someone who is. More than two dozen languages are covered, with those languages that commonly appear and those that present complex problems being considered most fully. The chapter begins with the treatment of words and phrases, titles of works, and quotations, the principles of which apply to most of the languages discussed (see 11.3\u201317). It then addresses languages using the Latin alphabet, transliterated (or romanized) languages, classical Greek, Old English and Middle English, and American Sign Language. Individual languages or groups of languages are presented in alphabetical order within their particular sections. (For the treatment of personal names, see 8.7\u201318.)"}

The Unicode standard (published by the Unicode Consortium; bibliog. 2.7) is widely supported by modern operating systems and browsers and many other applications (including word processors) and is required by such standards as XML and EPUB. Unicode assigns a unique identifying hexadecimal number (or code point) and description to tens of thousands of characters. Even fonts with Unicode character mapping, however, typically support only a subset of the Unicode character set. For this reason, it is desirable to determine at the outset which characters will be needed for a publication. Table 11.1 lists special characters, with Unicode numbers and abbreviated descriptions, needed for each of the languages treated in this chapter that use the Latin alphabet. Table 11.2 lists special characters that may be needed for certain transliterated languages. For Russian (Cyrillic) and Greek characters, see tables 11.3, 11.4, and 11.5. Unicode numbers mentioned in text should be prefixed by U+ (e.g., U+00E0 for \u00e0)."}

(For proper nouns, see 11.4.) If such a word or phrase becomes familiar through repeated use throughout a work, it need be italicized only on its first occurrence. If it appears only rarely, however, italics may be retained.\n\nThe gr\u00e8ve du z\u00e8le is not a true strike but a nitpicking obeying of work rules.\nShe preferred to think of it optimistically as a sue\u00f1o reparador\u2014rather than, as in English, a sleep that was merely restful.\n\nUnless the term appears in a standard English-language dictionary and is being used as such, observe the capitalization conventions of the original language. In the following examples, the German word for computer (which is the same as the English word) is capitalized because it is a noun, and the French adjective fran\u00e7aise is lowercase even though it would be capitalized in English (as \u201cFrench\u201d). See also 11.18.\n\nThe German word for computer is Computer. The French word is ordinateur. In Spanish, the word is either computadora or ordenador, depending on region or context.\nWe were prepared to learn the nuances of la langue fran\u00e7aise.\n\nThe plurals of non-English words should be formed as in the original language (see also 7.12).\n\nWe were sent off with some beautiful Blumen (not Blumes [italic ess] and not Blumes [roman ess]).\n\nAn entire sentence or a passage of two or more sentences in another language is usually set in roman and, unless it is set as a block quotation or extract (see 13.9\u201329), enclosed in quotation marks (see 11.11)."}

This usage extends to named places and structures, institutions and companies, brand names, and other categories as discussed in chapter 8. (For titles of works, see 11.6\u201310.) Capitalization should follow predominant usage in the original language. In some cases, this may entail observing a preference for capitalization that runs counter to the conventions for generic text. If the editor is unfamiliar with the language, an expert, or the author, should be consulted; when in doubt, opt for sentence-style capitalization (see 8.158). See also 11.18.

Special considerations for a number of them are listed below. For the special characters required for each of these languages, see table 11.1. See also 11.6, 11.18.\n\nAlbanian. Since 1972, Albanian has had a single, unified orthography, based on a standard originally adopted in 1909. Writers and editors working with older texts may need to take historical context into account and determine whether a spelling is conditioned by the specific time when it was used or whether it is preferable to follow the current norm.\n\nCroatian and Bosnian. The former Serbo-Croatian language used both Latin and Cyrillic alphabets. The modern Bosnian and Croatian standard languages use only the Latin version of that same alphabet. Although the substitution of dj for \u0111 is sometimes seen (e.g., in informal correspondence), standard orthographic practice in all the successor languages of Serbo-Croatian distinguishes these two consistently. See also Serbian and Montenegrin.\n\nCzech, a Slavic language written in the Latin alphabet, uses many diacritical marks to indicate sounds not represented by this alphabet, as shown in table 11.1. Note that the lowercase d and t with caron (the single glyphs \u010f and \u0165, respectively) are often seen with an apostrophe instead.\n\nDanish. The polite second-person pronouns De, Dem, and Deres (increasingly rare, and not to be confused with the third-person pronouns de, dem, and deres) and the familiar I are capitalized in Danish. Until the middle of the twentieth century, common nouns were capitalized, as in German.\n\nDutch. For the capitalization of particles with personal names, see 8.10. Proper adjectives (as well as nouns) are capitalized as in English. When a word beginning with the diphthong ij is capitalized, both letters are capitals: IJsland. When a single letter begins a sentence, it is lowercased, but the next word is capitalized: \u2019k Heb niet\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0.\n\n\nFinnish. Because Swedish is the second official language in Finland, the Finnish alphabet taught in schools and the standard keyboard used in Finland include the Swedish a with ring above (see table 11.1).\n\nHawaiian. The Hawaiian alphabet was developed in the nineteenth century from the Latin alphabet. In addition to the five vowels with macrons listed in table 11.1, Hawaiian uses the \u2018okina, a glottal stop represented by a left single quotation mark (U+2018)\u2014for example, in the place-name Hawai\u2018i. See also 6.115.1\n\n\nHungarian uses a wide variety of accented vowels, as shown in table 11.1.\n\nIcelandic includes the consonants \u00d0\u00a0\u00f0 (eth) and \u00de\u00a0\u00fe (thorn), which were also used in Old and Middle English (see 11.122\u201324). (The eth, which never begins a word, is capitalized only in contexts where all capitals are used.) In addition to featuring an acute-accented version of each regular vowel (including \u00dd\u00a0\u00fd), Icelandic includes the vowels \u00c6\u00a0\u00e6 and \u00d6\u00a0\u00f6.\n\nNorwegian. The polite second-person pronouns De, Dem, and Deres (increasingly rare, and not to be confused with the third-person pronouns de, dem, and deres) are capitalized in Norwegian. Until the middle of the twentieth century, common nouns were capitalized, as in German.\n\nPolish. In formal address the second-person plural pronoun Pa\u0144stwo (you) is capitalized, as are related forms: Czekam na Tw\u00f3j przyjazd (I await your arrival); Pozdrawiam Ci\u0119! (Greetings to you!). Division of Polish words is similar to that of transliterated Russian (see 11.98\u2013108). Division normally follows syllabic structure (e.g., kom-pli-ka-cja; sta-ro-pol-ski). Note that the conjunction i (and) should never appear at the end of a line but must be carried over to the beginning of the next.\n\nPortuguese. Titles and nouns or adjectives denoting nationality are capitalized as in Spanish (see 11.61). Accented capitals, sometimes dropped in Portuguese running text, should always be used when Portuguese is presented in an English context.\n\nRomanian and Moldovan are now both written using the same Latin orthography. Note that \u0218\u00a0\u0219 and \u021a\u00a0\u021b\u2014Latin S\u00a0s and T\u00a0t with comma below\u2014often appear instead with a cedilla, though the comma is correct. \u00c2\u00a0\u00e2 and \u00ce\u00a0\u00ee represent identical sounds but have different etymological origins. The use of \u00c2\u00a0\u00e2 has been restricted, eliminated, and reinstated in whole or in part during various orthographic reforms. Writers and editors, therefore, should take care to determine whether a spelling is conditioned by the specific time when it was used or whether it is preferable to follow the current norm.\n\nSerbian and Montenegrin. The former Serbo-Croatian language used both Latin and Cyrillic alphabets. In the modern Montenegrin standard language, both versions of that alphabet are official. In the modern Serbian standard language, the Cyrillic version of that same alphabet is official, though the Latin alphabet is also used, as regulated by law. Note that although the substitution of dj for \u0111 is sometimes seen (e.g., in informal correspondence), standard orthographic practice in all the successor languages of Serbo-Croatian distinguishes these two consistently. In addition to the letters needed for Serbian, two extra letters are required for Montenegrin: \u015a\u00a0\u015b and \u0179\u00a0\u017a (see table 11.1). See also Croatian and Bosnian.\n\nSwedish. In Swedish, the second-person pronouns Ni and Er, traditionally capitalized in correspondence, are now lowercased in all contexts.\n\nTurkish and Azeri. Modern Turkish has undergone a number of orthographic reforms since the original change to the Latin alphabet in 1928. Differences in the spellings of a name or word can therefore depend on the time period. Writers and editors should take care to determine whether a spelling is conditioned by the specific time when it was used or whether it is preferable to follow the current norm. In Turkish, as in English, the names of months and days of the week are capitalized. The Azeri (Azerbaijani) standard alphabet in use since 1992 is identical to the Turkish alphabet except for the presence of \u018f\u00a0\u0259, Q\u00a0q, and X\u00a0x (lacking in Turkish), and the absence of vowels with circumflex. Conventions for capitalization and spelling are similar to those for Turkish. Note that in both languages, the letter i retains its dot when capitalized.\n\nTurkmen and Uzbek. Turkmenistan has successfully transitioned from a Cyrillic to a Latin alphabet. In Uzbekistan the transition is still ongoing. Uzbek requires no special characters aside from the left single quotation mark in the letters O\u2018\u00a0o\u2018 and G\u2018\u00a0g\u2018 (not shown in table 11.1).\n\n\n\n1. A modifier letter turned comma (U+02BB) may be used instead of a left single quotation mark to represent the \u2018okina and is preferred by some authors and publishers as a means of differentiating the glottal stop from the common mark of punctuation. In many typefaces, however, the two glyphs have an identical appearance."}

Authors should use correct terminology and notation and should carefully follow the conventions of their special fields.

As a general rule, mathematical copy, including displayed expressions, should \u201cread\u201d as clearly and grammatically as any other kind of copy. The signs for simple mathematical operations and relations have direct verbal translations: a < b reads \u201ca is less than b\u201d; a > b reads \u201ca is greater than b\u201d; a + b = c reads \u201ca plus b equals c.\u201d The translation is not always straightforward, however, as is the case with df(x)\/dx, which means \u201cthe derivative of the function f of x with respect to x\u201d and is not the quotient of two numbers df(x) and dx. Moreover, mathematical notation is often abbreviated: the pair of inequalities a < b and b < c is usually written a < b < c. In mathematics it is also standard to read terms with indices, such as xi (\u201cx sub i\u201d), as plural or singular depending on the context (e.g., \u201cfor a unique xi\u201d and \u201cfor all the xi\u201d are both grammatically correct).

If, however, the editor does not use general instructions but underlines all letters to be set italic, then letters not underlined will be set, as implied, in roman type. Double underlining is used to indicate small capitals. Wavy underlining is used for boldface. Color codes are often used to indicate other typefaces.

From neither party, when in power, has the world any benefit to expect in science, art, or humanity, at all commensurate with the resources of the nation.\nThe passage might be shortened as follows:\nThe spirit of our American radicalism is destructive and aimless.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0.
