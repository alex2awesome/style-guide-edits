# style-guide-edits

This is the repository for the style-guides edits project.

`notebooks/` is where I've been exploring different prompting approaches to generate synthetic data.

`corpora/` is where the style guides I scraped are stored.

`tasks/` contains some scripts to run different parts of the wake/sleep cycle on the servers. They include `prompts.py`, the set of prompts I was experimenting with.
