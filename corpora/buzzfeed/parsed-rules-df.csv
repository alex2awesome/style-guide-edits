0,"A-list , B-list, etc. (n. and adj.)","Use when referring to celebrities, e.g., “A-list celeb,” “celeb on the D-list.”"
1,ABCs,
2,abbreviations and acronyms,"• In most cases, do not use an acronym or abbreviation on first reference.
• If it is clear and familiar enough in context, no need to put it in parentheses after a spelled-out reference; use your judgment.
• Lowercase acronyms with six letters or more, e.g., “Nasdaq” (exception: NASCAR
).
• Possessive acronyms ending in S — like CBS or PBS — should take an ’s, not just an apostrophe, e.g., “CBS’s sitcoms,” “PBS’s programs,” etc.
• Abbreviations should always be written in all caps, even if the abbreviation includes a preposition with fewer than four letters, e.g., “DOD” for Department of Defense (exception: “ GoT ” for Game of Thrones ).
• Do not use a period when abbreviating adverbs like “very” and “pretty,” e.g., “The weather is v nice today”; “He did a p good job.”
Well-known acronyms and abbreviations do not need to be spelled out, even on first reference, e.g., CDC, CEO, ER, FDA, HBCU, HR, LAPD, MIT, NGO, NYPD, TSA, UCLA, UN, UNESCO, USDA"
3,ableism (see also disability ),"• Avoid ableist language (discriminating against people with disabilities), including figurative use of words like lame , crutch , or handicap (which historically described physical disabilities) and crazy , stupid , or insane (once used as official diagnoses for people housed in institutions) and idioms like lame duck (opt for outgoing president
), turns a blind eye , or falls on deaf ears (use willfully ignorant
instead) . See Lydia X. Z. Brown’s glossary of ableist language to consider which words and terms to avoid and “ Ableism Is Embedded In Our Language. We Can Dismantle It. ”
• Use nondisabled
or person without a disability
rather than able-bodied , which implies that people with disabilities lack “able bodies,” per NCDJ guidance .
• Use low support needs
or high support needs
when writing about disabled people. Avoid high- and low-functioning ; how someone is “functioning” can change day to day, but support needs do not change so often. Avoid special needs , differently abled , and handicapable ."
4,abortion,"• When writing about abortion, use pro–abortion rights
(adj.) and abortion rights advocate
or activist
rather than pro-choice . Use anti-abortion
(adj.) and anti-abortion advocate
or activist
rather than pro-life .
• Avoid heartbeat bill unless it’s in a direct quotation.
• Use SB 8
in references to Texas’s six-week abortion ban."
5,J.J. Abrams,
6,ABV,(for alcohol by volume )
7,AC,(for air conditioning )
8,AI,
9,academic degrees,"• Bachelor’s
and master’s degrees
are possessive (whether used with or without the word “degree”); associate degree
is not. Capitalize in the following instances: “Bachelor of Arts,” “Master of Science,” etc.
• Style degrees like JD and MD thusly.
• “Dr.” is unnecessary before a person’s name if their degrees follow, e.g., “Janie Smith, MS, MD, FACOG.”
• If someone holds a PhD in a nonmedical field, do not use “Dr.” before their name. If it’s necessary to say a person has a doctorate, express as “who has a PhD in” or “who holds a doctorate in” after their name."
10,addiction,"• Follow AP guidance and use person-first language when writing about addiction.
• Use terms like person addicted to drugs
or person with a drug addiction
. Avoid addict , user , abuser , and other terminology that reinforces stigma or is derogatory.
• Use person with alcoholism
, person recovering from alcoholism
, or person with an alcohol addiction
. Avoid an alcoholic unless individuals prefer that term.
• Use terms like misuse
, heavy use
, or risky use
when discussing addiction, which is a disease. Abuse can be stigmatizing.
• Avoid clean when talking about sobriety.
• Do not use the terms addiction
and dependence
interchangeably. Addiction usually refers to a disease or disorder; dependence may not involve one, as with some babies born to mothers who use drugs or cancer patients who take prescribed painkillers.
• Finally, avoid using the language of addiction to describe an activity someone does a lot (e.g., “He is addicted to his phone”; “TikTok is addictive”), including derogatory terminology (e.g., “He’s a TV junkie”). Opt for phrasing like “She watches Netflix constantly” and “They can’t stop scrolling through Instagram.”"
11,addresses,"For New York City street and avenue names that use numbers, always use numerals in street names (“6th Street,” “23rd Street”) and spell out the number in avenue names (“Second Avenue,” “Tenth Avenue”)."
12,administration,"(lowercase “a,” e.g., “It has been something the administration has avoided” or “the Biden administration”)"
13,adoption,"• Use the neutral phrase place for adoption
rather than give up for adoption , e.g., “She placed the child for adoption,” to avoid negative connotations that “give up” may imply.
• Be mindful of using the appropriate terminology when describing nonadoptive parents. The terms birth parent
and biological parent
may not always be interchangeable. For example, a surrogate can birth a child without being a biological parent, and a sperm donor can be a biological but not birth parent. Use context (and, where applicable, a subject’s preference) as your guide.
• To avoid othering adopted people, only mention someone's adoptive status if it's pertinent to the story."

21,ages,"• Use numerals for specific ages (“The 5-year-old had a party”; “She was turning 30”).
• Use numerals for decades (“in your 30s”), but “twentysomething,” per MW .
• Use older adult(s)
or older person/people
rather than senior citizens , seniors , or elderly . Do not use the elderly to refer to a group, as the term is vague and can be dehumanizing. Include age specifics when possible, e.g., “people 65 and older qualify.”"

39,America,"Generally, avoid America as a noun or adjective when referring to the United States , as it can also refer to other parts of the Americas and tends to be very US-centric. American(s)
is OK when discussing people from the United States."
40,Amex,(for American Express)
41,amfAR,(American Foundation for AIDS Research)
42,amirite,
43,ampersands,"• Generally do not use spaces on either side of ampersands in constructions like Q&A, R&B, etc.
• NEVER use a serial comma before an ampersand.
• Don’t use an ampersand as a stand-in for “and” in headlines or running copy.
• If using ampersands in recipe names, be consistent with their use throughout a post.
• Adhere to self-stylization for companies, titles, musical artists, etc., that use an ampersand."
44,anti-,"• Hyphenate unless listed as closed in MW , e.g., “anti-gay,” “anti-labor,” “anti-terrorism,” but “antibiotic,” “antioxidant,” “antisocial.”
• Use anti- prefix for terms related to discrimination instead of -phobic, e.g., anti-LGBTQ or anti-gay, not homophobic; anti-trans not transphobic; anti-Islam, not Islamophobia; anti-fat, not fatphobic."

57,AstroTurf,"(trademark), “astroturf”
(in quotation marks for fake grassroots support)"
58,attribution,"• Generally, all quotes should have attribution, even if it is obvious who is speaking. Avoid using colons to introduce quotes that are fewer than two sentences long; otherwise, aim for attribution within or after the first sentence of a quote. “Said” is the preferred verb for attribution; avoid she noted , he laughed , they contended , etc. “Explain” is also frequently misused; is the person quoted really explaining something?
• Put the word of attribution after the name except when including an identifier, e.g., “ Rihanna said,” but “said Rihanna, who recently reached billionaire status.” See also quotations
.
• In crowdsourced posts or posts with anecdotes by several different editors/people, quotation marks around the blurb are not necessary. Just add a “—FirstName LastName” (or “—Anonymous”) after the anecdote in italics."
59,autism,"Generally, use the phrasing autistic person
rather than person with autism unless it appears in a direct quote. There are differing opinions within autistic communities about the language of identity, so ask an individual how they would like to be identified when possible. For more information, see “ How Autistic People Are Showing the Limitations of Person-First Language. ”"

• Lowercase “the” in band names that officially start with “the,” e.g., the Beatles, the Rolling Stones, the Strokes.
• K-pop artists: Don’t cap every letter in an artist’s or band’s name, even if it often appears as such, e.g., G-Dragon, not G-DRAGON; Psy, not PSY."

104,body image,"• Avoid the phrases  real women ,  regular women , and  normal women  (or  everyday people  to talk about people). Instead, use  nonmodels
if you’re looking to describe people who are not professional models.
• Be mindful of the terminology people use for themselves. Some are very publicly averse to the “plus-” label, for instance (though sometimes use of “plus-size” may be necessary in heds/deks for guiding the right people to the right post). Some people prefer “fat” for its directness or as a way of reclaiming the word; others prefer “curvy”; others prefer both or neither. If it’s unclear what a subject’s preferred terminology is, or if there’s no specific subject, offer multiple options.
• If your post uses Instagram to illustrate a particular quality, e.g., a big butt, search the appropriate hashtag rather than assigning that quality to someone.
• This goes without saying: Always avoid  any  type of body-shaming.
• When warranted, include the following copy at the bottom of the post in italics:  TheNational Eating Disorders Associationhelpline is 1-800-931-2237; for 24/7 crisis support, text “NEDA” to 741741. body slam

• On first reference, insert byline one space after body copy ends, formatted as follows (em dash, no space, full name, italics):  —Marty Rodriguez
• On second and subsequent references, format byline as follows (em dash, initials each followed by a period, no spaces): — M.R.
• If an editor who does not appear in a story’s byline contributed reporting to a story, add their credit at the end of the post as follows:  Marty Rodriguez contributed reporting to this story.
• At the end of a first-person story told to our editors, use italics, full name, and period on a new line after the last paragraph:  As told to Marty Rodriguez."

134,Cantopop,
135,capitalization,"• Capitalize words that are “often” or “usually” capped per  MW .
Never begin a sentence with a lowercase letter UNLESS it’s a very well-known brand (like iPad or eBay), though where possible, avoid the awkwardness of starting a sentence with a lowercase letter.
• With directionals, lowercase “north,” “south,” “east,” “west,” etc., unless using them to refer to specific regions, e.g., the Northeast, the South, the Western Hemisphere, Southern California, East Africa, West Africa, Eastern Europe, Western Europe). Lowercase directionals when referring to nondefined regions, e.g., “eastern/western Ukraine,” “southeast Brooklyn.”
• Product and brand names should be initial-capped unless that name is made of initials, e.g., Ugg, Gap, Ikea, Asos, AT&T (exception:  MAC
).
• Product names styled in all lowercase by the company should be capitalized in copy, e.g., iPod Nano, not iPod nano.
• Intercaps that delineate new words are OK: BlackBerry, eBay, iPod, NyQuil, etc. Intercaps that are just graphic treatments are not: Prana, not prAna.
• Do not adhere to vanity capitalization in media, e.g., Rihanna’s  Anti ; if there’s an album named  The BeSt tHiNg EveR , please just style as  The Best Thing Ever ."

to refer to ground dried chile peppers (e.g., “ground ancho chiles” or “ground cayenne chile”). Use  chili powder

170,"cities, states, and regions","• Spell out state names in copy when preceded by a city, e.g., “This happened in Boca Raton, Florida, in 2020.”
• LA is acceptable for Los Angeles on first reference, but other city abbreviations (NYC, SF, DC) should not be used on first reference in body copy.
• Descriptions of a Long Island background should include a specific town, e.g., “They’re from Manhasset, New York” (not “They’re from Long Island, New York”). As an adjective, “Long Island” can stand alone without “New York,” e.g., “The Long Island singer recorded her first album at the age of 18.”
• Use datelines in all original reported news stories, spelling out both the city and state or country name in full. Our style is as follows: MULESHOE, Texas — Running copy lorem ipsum etc. etc. etc.
• The following US city names are well known enough to stand alone without a state, both in datelines and in running text (supplementing the list in AP, which has not been re-created here). Note: Just use “Washington” for DC datelines, but “Washington, DC” in running text: Atlanta • Atlantic City • Austin • Baltimore • Berkeley • Boston • Chicago • Cincinnati • Cleveland • Dallas • Denver • Detroit • Honolulu • Houston • Indianapolis • Las Vegas • Los Angeles • Memphis • Miami • Miami Beach • Milwaukee • Minneapolis • Nashville • New Orleans • New York • Oakland • Oklahoma City • Orlando • Philadelphia • Phoenix • Pittsburgh • Sacramento • St. Louis • Salt Lake City • San Antonio • San Diego • San Francisco • Seattle.
• Other prominent smaller US regions like those listed here may not require a state to ID them, but the context must be considered: Aspen • Bel-Air  • Beverly Hills • Big Sur • Buffalo • Cape Cod • Compton • Des Moines • Fort Lauderdale • the Hamptons • Harlem • Hollywood • Malibu • Martha’s Vineyard  • Nantucket • Santa Fe • Santa Monica • Silicon Valley • Soho (NYC and London) • South Beach • Times Square; also New York’s five boroughs (Brooklyn, Bronx, Manhattan, Queens, Staten Island).
• The following non-US cities and regions can stand alone (for Canadian provinces, adding the province name after a city is sufficient — “Montreal, Quebec,” not “Montreal, Quebec, Canada”): Acapulco • Amsterdam • Athens • Baghdad • Bangkok • Barcelona • Beijing • Belfast • Berlin • Budapest • Buenos Aires • Brussels • Cairo • Copenhagen • Dublin • Edinburgh  • Florence • Frankfurt • Geneva • Glasgow • Havana • Hong Kong • Istanbul • Jerusalem • Kyiv • Lisbon • Liverpool • London • Madrid • Manila • Mexico City • Milan • Monte Carlo • Montreal • Moscow • Mumbai • Munich • Nairobi • Oslo • Ottawa • Panama City • Paris • Prague • Quebec • Rio de Janeiro • Rome • Saigon • Sarajevo • Seoul • Shanghai • Singapore • St. Petersburg • Stockholm • Sydney • Tehran • Tel Aviv • Tokyo • Toronto • Tuscany • Vancouver • Vatican City • Venice • Vienna • Warsaw • Zurich"

178,Coca-Cola,
179,cockblock,
180,colons,"• Complete sentences following a colon are capped; incomplete sentences following a colon are not capped.
• In US stories, generally avoid using colons to introduce quotes that are fewer than two sentences long."

185,coming-out,"(adj., n.);  come out

186,commander in chief,(no hyphens)
187,commas,"• BuzzFeed uses the serial (aka Oxford) comma, e.g., “We picked up cyan, magenta, yellow, and black balloons for the party.”
• With “too”:
• When “too” is used in the sense of “in addition,” use a comma, e.g., “ Oh, Joe Biden Won Nevada, Too ,” but omit the comma when “too” refers to the subject of the sentence, e.g., “Oh, you like cats? I like cats too.”
• Also use commas with “too” when you want to emphasize an abrupt change of thought, e.g., “He didn’t know at first what hit him, but then, too, he hadn’t ever walked in a field strewn with garden rakes” (from  Chicago Manual of Style ).
• No commas before “Jr.” or “Sr.” in names.
• To create a list within a sentence, use numbers or lowercase letters and closing parentheses and separate items with a comma, e.g., “When I grow up, I want to own a farm that has a) acres and acres of land, b) goats of all shapes and sizes, and c) a pack of huskies for dogsledding.”
• Do not use a comma between words repeated for emphasis, e.g., “It’s what makes her her,” not “It’s what makes her, her.”"
188,company and institution names,"In general, refer to a company as “it,” not “they.” In lighthearted, non-News posts, it’s OK to personify brands by using “they,” especially if the alternative sounds awkward and/or stilted. Omit Co., Corp., Inc., Ltd., etc. Do not capitalize “the” in an organization’s name, even if it is part of its official title, e.g., the North Face."
189,composition titles,"• Names of movies, TV shows, books, albums, plays, art exhibitions/collections, web series, podcasts, radio programs, media franchises, newsletters, and video games are styled with italics.
• Movie/play scenes, television episodes, article headlines, chapters, song titles, individual pieces of art (e.g., Leonardo da Vinci's ""Mona Lisa,"" Vincent Van Gogh's ""Sunflowers,"" Pablo Picasso's ""Guernica""), and names of studies use quotes.
• News publication names (both print and digital), magazine and journal titles, news organizations, and local news affiliates should be in roman type. Do not capitalize “the” in the names of print/web publications or companies or institutions, even if it is part of the official title, e.g., the New York Times.
• Italicize titles of newsletters that contain more than one article and are broken down into article-like sections, but use roman type (no quotation marks) for other (typically shorter, less dense) newsletters.
• Still unsure? See AP vs. Chicago’s handy  cheat sheet  for when to italicize vs. use quotes.
• Titles that would normally be italicized (movie names, TV shows, books, etc.) are set off with quotes in headlines (since they cannot be italicized in headlines/list subheds in our CMS). Do not, however, put ship or other vessel names in quotes in headlines! Use good judgment, though, if readability is an issue, e.g., this is an acceptable exception to the publication-titles-in-roman rule: “Solange Explained The Importance Of Intersectional Feminism Perfectly In This Month’s ‘Bust.’”
• Titles of issues (including the word ""issue"") should be capitalized and in roman type, e.g., Now Toronto's Body Issue."
190,Con Edison,"( Con Ed
OK on second reference)"
191,Constitution,"• Capitalize references to the  US Constitution
(with or without the “US” modifier), but lowercase “the state constitution,” the “nation’s constitution,” etc. • Lowercase “constitutional” in all references.
• Other countries’ constitutions take an initial cap with a modifier, e.g.,  Mexican Constitution
, but  Mexico’s constitution
.
• Spell out the numbers in the first nine amendments and use cap “A” when referencing specific amendments to the Constitution, e.g., First Amendment, 19th Amendment."

196,coroner’s office,"(lowercase regardless of whether it follows a jurisdiction’s name. see also district attorney’s office
)"
197,corrections,"• A correction should include the accurate information. It should explain the error, and it may restate the error when it’s necessary to clarify what it was or to debunk a claim. See sample corrections at the end of this section.
• Corrections should be made for errors of fact — not misspellings, typos, or broken links. DO issue a correction, however, if a person or brand’s name is misspelled throughout a story (even if a name appears only once and is misspelled).
• If a correction is issued for a misspelling, it should be stated simply as  [TK person]’s name was misspelled in an earlier version of this post.
• The correction’s tone should echo the tone of the item, in keeping with its gravity. For a factual error in, say, a funny list, the language can be fairly colloquial and even humorous as long as it contains the basic building blocks — “we got something wrong, and here is the correct information”; for a news error, the language should be sober and direct. A basic mistake on a list of weird facts about  Love Actually  can begin with “Gah!”; a correction of an error of fact in a news story should not.
• Corrections should be in plain English, not in the somewhat formal corrections style traditional among news organizations.
• Be very thorough and careful. The absolute worst thing is to have to correct your correction. If the correction is about a person, it’s often a good move to read the correction on the phone to its subject before printing it.
• Try to mention the correction on all channels the story went out on — if you tweeted it, tweet the correction, etc.
• Using the “correction” option will autoformat and timestamp your correction.
• Don’t add a correction without first running the proposed correction by your editor or team leader.
• If someone on social media pointed out the error, be generous to that person — whether you are feeling generous or not, and no matter how obnoxious the comment. That person did you a favor by improving your piece. On Twitter, if possible, end the correction with “(H/T: @twittercorgi)” and a link to the tweet in question. If a hat tip appears in a dek or in the middle of running copy as a stand-alone sentence, use end punctuation."
198,"correction examples: • Newsy, simple correction","Twitter increased the value of its IPO shares to between $23 and $25. An earlier version of this post misstated the value range.
• Newsy, restating the error:  Twitter’s CEO could not be reached for comment. An earlier version of this post said Twitter’s CFO could not be reached for comment.  (This is also an example of when what was maybe just a typo warrants a correction rather than just a quick fix.)
• Newsy, where BuzzFeed reported what was correct at the time but was later found to be incorrect:  An earlier version of this article, using information provided by the Las Cruces Police Department, misstated Battista’s charges. He is charged with breaking and entering .
• Humorous, simple correction:  Gah! Miley was first documented twerking in public on Jan. 20, 2013. An earlier version of this post had the wrong date.
• Humorous, restating the error:  Oops! Samantha moved to London in the  Sex and the City  revival. An earlier version of this post said she died. RIP our mentions!
Other examples where restating the error is necessary:
•  Cronkite covered the D-Day landing from a warplane. An earlier version of this post said he had stormed the beaches.
•  On Drake’s new album, a credit wasn’t listed for the producer on the first track. An earlier version of this post said that a credit wasn’t listed for the writer.Siberian tigers are the most endangered big-cat species. An earlier version of this post said pumas were the most endangered big-cat species."
199,corrections vs. updates,"Updates should be used to reflect important new information or clarifications; corrections are for mistakes (see  updates
).


: Updates should be used to reflect important new information or clarifications; corrections are for mistakes (see  updates
)."
200,Nikolaj Coster-Waldau,
201,councilor,"(e.g., member of a city council);  counselor
(senior adviser);  counsel
(n. or v., guidance or adviser, e.g., on legal matters)"
202,courts,"• Always use numerals for circuit courts, even as part of formal name, e.g., “US Court of Appeals for the 7th Circuit,” “7th Circuit judge,” “the circuit court.”
• Italicize court cases/criminal trials and use  v.
, not  vs.
, e.g.,  Roe v. Wade . OK to italicize shorthand for court cases if they’re well known, e.g.,  Citizens United .
• Use an en dash to denote decisions, e.g., “2–1,” “5–4.”"
203,"COVID-19 , the coronavirus pandemic","• The disease caused by the novel coronavirus is called  COVID-19
(commonly shortened to  COVID
), which stands for “coronavirus disease 2019.”
• When we talk about cases of people who are sick, it makes sense to say “COVID-19 cases” and “deaths from COVID-19.” Similarly, people can be “infected by the coronavirus,” but they “get COVID-19.” When reporting on mass death, use phrasing that emphasizes the people behind the numbers: “X number of people have died” is better than “there have been X number of deaths.” Use direct language when writing about deaths, such as “she died,” rather than euphemistic language, such as “her life was lost” or “she passed away.”
• Do not conflate  rate
and  count
when writing about cases or deaths; a rate is one number divided by another. Also avoid conflating  infections
with  reported cases
. The true number of COVID-19 infections is not known because many people may have been infected but never tested.
• A phrase like “X number of deaths were reported yesterday” is more accurate than “X number of people died yesterday.” There is a lag in how COVID deaths are reported, so attributing a specific number to a particular date is never accurate.
• The  PCR test
(stands for  polymerase chain reaction ) and  antigen
(or  rapid
) test are the two main COVID test categories. The former detects RNA specific to the coronavirus, while the latter detects proteins from the virus."

221,dashes,
222,em dash,"• Create the em dash with keystroke option + shift + hyphen (on Macs)/alt + 0151 (on PCs)
• Use the em dash to set off a phrase in a sentence, e.g., “I subsist off kefir — my breakfast of choice.” Try to avoid use of the em dash when parentheses, commas, or a semicolon would work just as well. Use spaces on either side of the em dash in this usage.
• When an em dash is used to indicate interrupted speech, set it flush with the text and closing quotation mark: “I’m throwing my dog a bar mitz—”
• For bylines, no space precedes the name (in italics), like so:  —Marty Rodriguez  (for more guidance, see  bylines
)."
223,en dash,"• Create the en dash with the keystroke option + hyphen (on Macs)/alt + 0150 (on PCs)
• Do not use a space between the en dash and the adjacent words or numbers.
Use an en dash 1) to represent a span or range of numbers, dates, or times (2003–2010, June 13–Nov. 19, 9 a.m.–5 p.m.); 2) for scores and votes (“the House voted 230–197”); 3) between words to represent connection (“US–Mexico border”); 4) to create compound adjectives with an open name or phrase (“the Washington, DC–based movie,” “the woman of color–owned business”); 5) to indicate temperatures below zero, e.g., “–10 degrees.”"
224,dashcam,
225,dates,"• “September 1961,” “spring 1955” are preferred over “September of 1961,” “spring of 1955” in news stories.
• In most stories, format full dates as follows: “Oct. 3, 1983.” In features and essays, however, it is acceptable to spell out dates in full (“October 3, 1983”). Do not use “1st,” “2nd,” “3rd,” etc., in dates.
• Capitalize the names of months in all uses. When a month is used with a specific date, abbreviate only Jan., Feb., Aug., Sept., Oct., Nov., and Dec. Spell out the month when using by itself or with a year alone.
• When a phrase lists only a month and a year, do not separate the year with commas. When a phrase refers to a month, day, and year, set off the year with commas.
• Examples (these apply to headlines and deks as well):
• “March 1983 was a good month because that’s when I came into the world.”
• “Feb. 4 was the coldest day of the month.”
• “His birthday is April 17.”
• “Feb. 14, 2009, was the worst Valentine’s Day ever.”
• “Episode 3 airs Saturday, Feb. 1, at 10:30 p.m.”
• “They were the editor of the yearbook for the 2018–19 school year.”"

228,daylong,", dayslong"
229,deadlift,"(n., v.)"
230,deaf,"• The lowercase  deaf
refers to someone with no hearing. The capitalized  Deaf
is used by members of Deaf communities in relation to identity and culture. Avoid using  hearing-impaired ; use phrasing such as  hard of hearing
or  partially deaf
.
• Do not use the term  deaf-mute ; the preferred phrasing is that an individual cannot hear or speak. (A person who does not speak may or may not be deaf.)
• Per the  National Center on Disability and Journalism , the terms deafblind, deafblindness, deaf-blind, and deaf-blindness are acceptable. Hyphenate or close up based on an individual’s preference."

(n.)"
241,disability,"• We adhere to the  AP Stylebook ’s guidelines, which advise: “In general, do not describe an individual as disabled unless it is clearly pertinent to a story. If a description must be used, try to be specific.  An ad featuring actor Michael J. Fox swaying noticeably from the effects of Parkinson’s disease drew nationwide attention.  Avoid descriptions that connote pity, such as  afflicted with  or  suffers from multiple sclerosis . Rather,  has multiple sclerosis
.” Do not use the word  handicapped  to describe people. Say  accessible parking/stall
rather than  handicapped .
• Ask a person whether they prefer people-first language (using a person’s name or the word “people” or “person” before a condition — “a person with a disability”) or identity-first language (“disabled person”). If you cannot ask someone their preference, either is fine. See also  people-first language
.
• Use  mentally disabled
,  developmentally disabled
, or  intellectually disabled
.
• Use  wheelchair user
rather than  confined to a wheelchair or  wheelchair-bound . Only specify why a wheelchair is used if it is relevant to the story.
• Avoid words that have ableist connotations or make light of disabilities. Instead of describing something as figuratively  crippled  or  handicapped , use  hampered
,  obstructed
, or  inhibited
; instead of  tone-deaf , use  insensitive
,  obtuse
, or  oblivious
.
• The term  sign language
is lowercase, but capitalize  American Sign Language
( ASL
on second reference). Someone who communicates in sign language is a  signer
, e.g., “an ASL signer.”
• Use  nondisabled
, not  able-bodied , when referring to people who do not have disabilities (see also  ableism
).
• For further guidelines, refer to the National Center on Disability and Journalism’s  style guide  and the National Disability Rights Network’s  Guidelines for Reporting and Writing About People With Disabilities ."
242,disease,"We adhere to the  AP Stylebook ’s guidelines, which advise: “Avoid such expressions as:  He is battling cancer. She is a stroke victim.  Use neutral, precise descriptions:  He has stomach cancer. She is a stroke patient. ” Avoid describing sobriety as “clean” unless in quotations, since it implies a previous state of dirtiness instead of disease."

284,ellipses,"• Use three dots in a row, no spaces between the dots: ...
• If an ellipsis is used to indicate a mid-sentence pause, don’t use a space on either side, e.g., “We could go there...or not.” If an ellipsis is used to indicate a trailing off in thought or a long pause before a full sentence, insert a space before the next sentence, e.g., “I don’t know... Certainly, I don’t think it will be good.”
• If an ellipsis is used after a full sentence to indicate omission of one or more full sentences (as in a spoken quote), use a period followed by a space before the ellipsis, e.g., “We moved to New Orleans in 2010. ... By 2012, we were back in New York.”
• If an ellipsis is used to indicate omission of words in a spoken quote rather than a full sentence or is inserted mid-sentence, use a space on either side of the ellipses, e.g., “I adopted the cat yesterday and he’s the best. He’s already made himself right at home” would become “I adopted a cat yesterday ... He’s already made himself right at home”; “Let’s hang out on Saturday and do something fun because the weather is supposed to be nice” would become “Let’s hang out on Saturday ... the weather is supposed to be nice.”
• If an ellipsis is used at the beginning of a text box/subheading, do not follow with a space, and generally lowercase the word following the ellipsis.
• When inserting an ellipsis in a written quote, use brackets to indicate it was added by an editor and not part of the original text.

• Use title case and quotes when citing a headline in the body of an article.
• Treat deks as sentences with normal punctuation, and use roman type.
• Subheadings and lists: Use common sense re: capitalization. Err on the side of consistency. If most sentences are full sentences, style and punctuate them accordingly. If it reads more like titles of images/things, e.g., Grumpy Cat, This Guy, Your Brother, recipe names, initial-capitalize each word (except for prepositions, articles, conjunctions that are three letters or fewer — and, at, but, for, of, etc.) and do not use end punctuation. REMINDER: In headlines/subheadings with initial-capped words, always capitalize “Is,” “Be,” and “Are,” which, although all puny words, are indeed verbs!
• In lists, retain the “The” in superlative headlines, e.g., “The 30 Most Inspiring Films,” “The 25 Best GIFs Of 2016.”
• With the exception of quizzes, generally avoid questions as headlines, particularly news headlines posed as ones that can be answered with a yes or no."

434,homelessness,"• Use phrases like  person experiencing homelessness
,  person who is homeless
, and  person without a home
in running copy rather than  homeless person . Some activists also use  unhoused
or  houseless
to describe this population, emphasizing the distinction between having a house and having a home.
•  Homeless person/people
is OK for a headline where brevity is key, but avoid collective nouns like  the homeless  or  the needy . Individualizing the housing crisis and using people-first language helps us avoid perpetuating harmful stereotypes.
Only mention someone’s housing situation when it is relevant. Use straightforward language and avoid descriptions that connote pity (e.g.,  struggling with homelessness ).
•  Homeless shelter
is an acceptable term for temporary residences typically operated by the local government.
•  Unhoused
can be used in place of  homeless
and can describe someone who has been evicted.  Unsheltered
generally refers to someone who lives in a tent, vehicle, or other structure rather than consistently sleeping at a homeless shelter. Opt for people-first language, e.g., “people who are unsheltered,” in running text (these are newer terms and may not work well in headlines)."

451,hyphens,"• Do NOT use a hyphen after an adverb (not limited to but including most words ending in “-ly”), e.g., “It was a poorly written book,” not  poorly-written .
• Note that other adverbs besides ones ending in “-ly” also don’t need hyphens (“the almost empty glass,” “an often misunderstood rule,” “a very strong beer,” etc.) unless their meaning is ambiguous, e.g., “a little-regarded athlete,” “a still-unknown number,” “a well-known presenter.”
• Hyphens are usually not used when a phrase is made up entirely of nouns, e.g., “video game console,” “crime scene cleanup,” “toilet paper roll,” especially when the modifying compound noun can be found in the dictionary.
• When adding a prefix before a compound adjective, use hyphens between all components, e.g., “a non-habit-forming drug” — but in extreme cases it’s better to reword the sentence to avoid awkward punctuation.
• In a list where an element of the modifying phrase is not repeated, use a suspended hyphen, like so: “a university-owned and -operated bookstore”; “second-, third-, and fourth-grade teachers.”
• Slashes are OK in specific contexts (like “and/or”), but use hyphens for basic compounds and double titles like “singer-songwriter” (not  singer/songwriter ) or “writer-director.”
• When a modifying phrase is longer than a couple of words, quotation marks can sometimes be easier to read than a ton of hyphens, e.g., “He heaved a ‘back to the drawing board’ sigh.” Use quotes rather than hyphens in a modifying phrase that would be said aloud, e.g., “a ‘press 1 for English’ call,” “a ‘shit is getting real’ afternoon.”
• When a hyphenated compound noun is part of a modifying phrase, use an en dash after the hyphenated noun, e.g., “an editor-in-chief–approved plan.”"

461,immigration,"• In running copy, refer to people fleeing their countries as “people” (and variations thereof: “people fleeing war,” “people escaping Eritrea,” “people fleeing for Europe,” “people escaping the war in Syria,” etc.). This allows us to humanize the crisis.
•  Undocumented immigrant
is acceptable terminology, but avoid  illegal immigrant  unless we’re referencing quoted material.
• Young undocumented immigrants brought to the US as children are referred to as  DREAMers
(retaining capitalization of the DREAM Act).
• Avoid the use of  import  in any form used to refer to international people.
• When shorthand is necessary, i.e., for headlines/deks, be precise:
• Use  migrant
when referring to someone seeking economic opportunity.
• Use  refugee
when referring to, per AP, “a person who is forced to leave [their] home or country to escape war, persecution or natural disaster.”
• The  UNHCR’s explainer  of the distinction between the words is a helpful resource.
• Refugee ban and travel ban describe different parts of the Trump administration’s contested immigration policy, with the latter describing the planned action against citizens of six Muslim-majority countries."

471,internet,"• Avoid “The Internet Did ____,” “All Of The Internet,” “Everyone On The Internet,” etc., as a frame/device in headlines.
• Also avoid using “...broke the internet” in both headlines and in running copy; instead opt for more descriptive, specific language."

or  sales rep
rather than  salesman ,  lawmaker
rather than  congressman/congresswoman ,  chair
rather than  chairman/chairwoman ,  spokesperson
or  representative
rather than  spokesman/spokeswoman . Avoid gendered terms like  actress ,  editrix , and  songstress  outside of direct quotes and titles. Instead of using a gendered term like  businessman , be specific — e.g., “entrepreneur,” “financier,” “broker,” “investor,” “business partner.”
• Only capitalize formal titles. Lowercase occupational descriptions before a name.
• Standard practice in entertainment coverage is never to capitalize a job title except when it starts a sentence. The same goes for every position on a movie set: “director Ava DuVernay,” “screenwriter Tina Fey,” etc. Executives within the studios, however, follow the standard AP rules for title capitalization.
• Use  Sen.
,  Rep.
,  Gov.
, etc., before a name and always cap them, even after an adjective (see below) — but those titles without names are lowercase and spelled out in full, e.g., “While Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Sen. Ed Markey introduced the Green New Deal, other Democratic representatives and senators had different approaches to address climate change.”
• When referring to more than one current officeholder, capitalize and abbreviate their titles, e.g., “Sens. Marsha Blackburn and Josh Hawley,” “Govs. Greg Gianforte and Michelle Lujan Grisham,” “Reps. Ayanna Pressley and Ilhan Omar.”
• Capitalize department names when preceding a name, but lowercase as a stand-alone title: “Education Secretary Miguel Cardona,” but “the education secretary signaled a significant change in policy.”
• Informal job titles are lowercase even before a name, e.g., “White House press secretary Jen Psaki,” “adviser Mike Donilon.”
• Job titles following a region name, political affiliation, or similar should still be capitalized when preceding a name, e.g., “Russian President Vladimir Putin,” “Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer,” “Democratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren.” Contrary to AP, lowercase a title after the words then, now, or former, e.g., “former president Donald Trump,” “then-president Ronald Reagan,” “now-president Joe Biden.”
• Lowercase and use an en dash for titles that have two or more words in “then–” constructions: “then–vice president Mike Pence,” “then–secretary of state Hillary Clinton.”
• For acting positions, lowercase “acting” but keep the title capitalized, e.g., “acting FDA Commissioner Janet Woodcock.”
• A politician’s party affiliation and the state they represent should routinely be included in a story as follows: “New Jersey Democratic Sen. Cory Booker,” “Sen. Chuck Grassley, an Iowa Republican,” etc. Do not use overly formal abbreviations like R-AL or D-NY following a name.
•  President-elect
(hyphen, lowercase “elect”);  Vice President–elect
(with an en dash). Lowercase when not preceding a name: “The president-elect tweeted at 5 a.m.” or “The cast of  Hamilton  directly addressed Mike Pence, then the vice president–elect, following a performance in November 2016.”"

rather than  Hispanic
when a broader term is necessary. (Defer to a person’s preference if possible.) Latine
and  Latinx
are acceptable variations, making room for multiple genders despite the restrictions of language. There is mostly overlap between those who identify as Latino and Hispanic, but not all: One example of Latinos who are not Hispanic are Brazilians. Use  Spanish
only to describe the people who are from Spain."

521,legislative and executive branches (US government),"• Lowercase  congressional
unless it’s part of a proper name, e.g., “congressional salaries,” but “the Congressional Quarterly,” “the Congressional Record.” Use numerals and capitalize  District
when joined with a number, e.g., “the 1st Congressional District,” “the 1st District.” Lowercase  congressional district
and  district
whenever they stand alone.
•  House of Representatives
,  the House
,  the Massachusetts House
, but in plural references,  the Massachusetts and Connecticut houses
.  Statehouse
(singular) is always initial-capped even when the name of the state doesn’t precede it, but plural  statehouses
takes a lowercase “s.”
• The  capitol
(lowercase) is the building in which lawmakers in each state meet, e.g., “The capitol building in Virginia is located on Bank Street.” It’s capped when referring to the US Capitol in Washington, DC, or those buildings in each state in constructions like “the New Hampshire Capitol.”  The Capitol
is used only in references to DC.  Capital
is used for a city or town where the seat of government is located, e.g., “Virginia’s capital is Richmond.”
• Refer to legislation as it’s most commonly known, e.g., Obamacare or the Affordable Care Act. In the absence of common shorthand, use the bill’s shortest proper title, not its number, e.g., the Justice Act, not S1689. Less well-known legislation should be followed by a short description.
• Refer to existing legislation in the present tense until attempts to repeal it are successful. Refer to legislation in the conditional tense if it hasn’t been passed, e.g., “The New York sex decriminalization bill would legalize paid sex between consenting adults.”
• A  majority
is more than half the votes cast; a  plurality
is the largest number of votes, but less than a majority; a  supermajority
is any institutionally defined threshold greater than a simple majority.
• Use an en dash to denote vote counts, e.g., “52–48.”
• Capitalize committee names, including inexact congressional committee names if they’ve become common parlance, e.g., US Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, Senate Intelligence Committee. When naming multiple committees, lowercase  committees
, e.g., “the Intelligence and Oversight committees.”
• Lowercase  executive order
in all uses.
• Capitalize department names, even when not stating the full name to avoid making it appear to be a generic reference, e.g., “The charity has received millions from the Interior” (not “the interior”); “Housing and Urban Development was quietly advising lenders to deny loans” (not “Housing and urban development was”)."
522,Lego,",  Legos
(plural)"
523,-less,"Usually closed up, but follow  MW ; hyphenate if not found in  MW , e.g., “childless,” but “audience-less,” “pants-less” (exception:  cashierless
)."
524,less vs. fewer,"Use “less” when referring to mass nouns, distance, or money; use “fewer” when referring to things that are quantifiable, e.g., “There was less of a risk with that option”; “There were fewer people at Li’s party than at Lucia’s.”"
525,letters (of the alphabet),"• Individual letters and combinations of letters are not usually set in quotes (exception: instances relating to spelling, e.g., “Her name is JoAnne with a capital ‘A’”).
• Letters that are used to represent shape are capitalized and not set in quotes, e.g., “an L-shaped couch.”
• Letters used to denote grades are capitalized and roman, e.g., “If Yolo Studies were a class, I’d totally get an A”; “I had straight A’s up until I started doing krokodil.”
• Italicize and lowercase letters denoting sounds, e.g., “I like the  o  and  a  sounds in the word.”
• Add an apostrophe + “s” to pluralize letters: “the four F’s (famous people, festivals, fashion, and food).”
• Add just an “s” to pluralize all abbreviations: DVDs, CDs, PhDs."
526,LGBTQ,
527,Community,"When referring to the broader community,  queer
(as in “queer people”),  LGBTQ,
or LGBTQ+
(as in “LGBTQ people”) is appropriate.  Gay  is not. “LGBTQ” and ""LGBTQ+"" are only appropriate when referring to the broader community or groups of people, not when referring to an individual. To be inclusive, fewer or added letters can be used as needed if reflective of a quote or an organization's name, e.g., ""LGBT center,"" ""LGBTQIA community.""   Identification
• Unless you already know based on research, it should be standard to ask how people identify themselves: gay, bi, genderqueer, queer, trans, etc.
• A person can be trans WITHOUT also being gay or lesbian. Don’t assume.
• Use  cisgender
(rather than  non-trans ) to refer to a person who is not transgender.  Cis
is also acceptable shorthand.
•  Trans
and  transgender
are generally interchangeable."
528,“Openly” vs. “Out”,
529,Openly,"is preferred over  out  as a modifying phrase, e.g., “openly gay” or “openly trans,” but the terms can be used interchangeably if a writer or subject prefers. Be mindful, however, of whether a modifier is necessary given a story’s or sentence’s context; using it may be redundant."
530,Transgender Terms,"(some of these are adapted from the  GLAAD Transgender Glossary of Terms )
•  Transgender
: An umbrella term (always an adjective, never a noun) for people whose gender identity and/or gender expression differs from what is typically associated with the sex they were assigned at birth. People under the transgender umbrella may describe themselves using one or more of a wide variety of terms, so use the descriptive term preferred by the person. Transgender people may or may not decide to alter their bodies hormonally and/or surgically.
•  Transsexual
: An older term (NOT an umbrella term), which originated in the medical and psychological communities. Use as an adjective and only if preferred by an individual.
•  Cross-dressing
: Occasionally wearing clothes traditionally associated with people of another sex. “Cross-dresser” should NOT be used to describe someone who has transitioned to live full-time as a gender other than the one assigned to them at birth or who intends to do so in the future.
• If a transgender person has changed their name, always use their chosen name. Never use the birth name of a trans person who has changed their name, a process referred to as  deadnaming
.
• Avoid pretransition photos in posts in which the subject is transgender. Never use ""before"" and ""after"" photos or stereotypically gendered imagery.
• Use a person’s current pronouns, even when describing events before their transition.
• Use  anti-transgender bathroom bill
( anti-LGBTQ bathroom bill
is OK in a hed or where space is limited) to describe legislation geared at banning transgender/nonbinary people from using bathrooms that correspond to their gender identity.
• Use transition
or gender-affirming care
, not sex reassignment or sex change . For more, consult the Trans Journalists Association style guide ."

627,money:,"• “99 cents,” “$8,” “$2 billion deficit”
• Do not include .00 in a price, e.g., “$17” (not “$17.00”).
• Style price ranges using an en dash and the currency symbol before both prices: “$10–$20”
• When a price includes both numerals and words, never hyphenate, even when preceding a noun, e.g., “the $1.7 million house” (not “$1.7-million”).
• Use symbols for dollars and British pounds (use option + 3 to get the £ symbol on non-UK Mac keyboards). Spell out all other currencies, e.g., euros, yen. For non-US dollars, clarify by using the currency’s abbreviation following the number, e.g., “$100 AUD,” “$25 CAD.”
• In headlines and videos, OK to abbreviate thousands, millions, and billions thusly: “A $75K Salary,” “4.2M People,” “A $16B Company,” etc.
more than vs. over: OK to use interchangeably, but typically, use “more” with quantities and “over” with spatial relationships, e.g., “There were more than 20 people packed into the apartment”; “The plane flew over the Atlantic Ocean.”"
628,monthlong,", monthslong"
629,Mormon,"Generally, follow  AP’s guidance . Use Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints on first reference in running copy, but Mormon and Mormon church are OK as qualifiers and in places where space is limited."

641,N95,(capitalize “N” and other letters when referring to air filtration certifications)
642,names,"• In news stories, use surnames on second reference (except for very young people); if there is a compelling reason to refer to a subject on first-name basis, that may be acceptable. If two or more people in the same story have the same surname, it’s OK to refer to all by their first name on second reference.
• East Asian cultures generally place surnames first and then given names, e.g., Bong Joon-ho. Second reference should be the family name, Bong in this case. North Korean names are styled as three words without a hyphen, e.g., Kim Jong Un. South Korean names are styled with a hyphen, e.g., Lee You-mi. Exception: South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeul. For more, AP has entries dedicated to Chinese and Korean naming conventions.
• With surnames beginning with “al-,” “el-,” or similar prefixes, drop the prefix on subsequent references if using the surname only, e.g., Muammar al-Qaddafi on first reference, Qaddafi on second."

Don’t casually use terms and phrases derived from Native American culture like  spirit animal ,  powwow , and  low man on the totem pole . Don’t use  off the reservation ,  circle the wagons , or other expressions with racist origins."
649,natural disasters,"• Capitalize “hurricane,"" ""tropical storm,"" ""typhoon,” or “superstorm” when it precedes the name that weather forecasters have assigned to a storm, e.g., Superstorm Sandy, Hurricane Katrina.
• Use only storm names assigned by national meteorological agencies. Agreed names for tropical cyclones, which form at sea and include tropical storms, hurricanes, and typhoons (in the Western Pacific), are listed by the World Meteorological Organization  here . European countries also assign names to storms that pose significant wind hazards. Avoid using names given by private agencies or companies, such as those used for North American winter storms by The Weather Channel.
• Use “its” when referring to a storm (or any other natural disaster); do not use personal pronouns like “his” and “her.”
• Always lowercase the word “fire” when referring to the names of wildfires, e.g., “the Silverado fire.”"

671,now,"When referring to time, do not use a comma, e.g., “I used to be completely terrified of heights. Now I’m generally OK with heights.” When used colloquially, use a comma, e.g., “Now, I’d never say that all cats are awesome, but I’ve never met one who wasn’t.”"
672,now-,Hyphenate phrases like “his now-husband” and “the now-president.”

• Be consistent when writing out numbers in succession, e.g. “9, 10, and 11,” NOT “nine, 10, and 11”; the same applies to ranges of numbers, e.g., “We are expecting eight to ten people” or “We are expecting 8 to 10 people” (both OK!).
• Use a comma in numbers expressing quantity that are four digits or more.
• Never start a sentence with a numeral — UNLESS a year starts a sentence (“2013 was a totally bodacious year”), but try to avoid this. Otherwise, spell out a number that starts a sentence and hyphenate all compound numbers from twenty-one through ninety-nine. (“Thirty-five cats live on that island”).
• Use “1 in 4 voters” (numerals) if it’s a large sampling. But spell out “six out of nine senators” because these are finite numbers under 10.
• “More than 1 in 4 children  are  blonde” (not “is” when the subject is plural). Use a singular verb in constructions like “Around 1 in 3 students  has  the flu.”
• In headlines: For lists, always use a numeral: “9 Adorable Photos Of Monkeys Riding Cats,” “8 Amazing GIFs Of Naked Presidents,” “5 Photo Stories That Will Challenge Your View Of The World.” For news headlines, use your best judgment: “Two Muslim Men Said Their American Airlines Flight Was Canceled After They Were Racially Profiled,” “A Shooter Killed 7 People At A Texas Nightclub.”
• Always use numerals in video captions."

• Cap and use  Democratic
(not  Democrat ) as an adjective when preceding a political official’s title, e.g., “California’s Democratic Attorney General Xavier Becerra.” Use  Democratic National Committee
on first reference,  DNC
thereafter;  Democratic National Convention
on first reference,  Democratic convention
thereafter.
• Cap and use  Democrat
when referring to a majority: “Democrat-controlled House” (not  Democratic , contrary to AP).
•  GOP
is OK in headlines and push notifications, but generally use only on second reference in place of  Republican Party
in running copy.  Republican National Committee
on first reference,  RNC
thereafter;  Republican National Convention
on first reference,  Republican convention
thereafter.
• OK to use  blue state
and  red state
for variety, but  Democratic-leaning
and  Republican-leaning
are preferred.
• Lowercase  the left
and  the right
in all references.  Left-wing
and  right-wing
are hyphenated as adjectives, but two words as nouns, e.g., “the left wing of the Democratic Party.”
• Use  alt-right

as a noun and  far-right
as adjective. Put  the “new right”
in quotes on first reference."
713,parts:,"Capitalize and use a numeral when describing elements of a work, including parts, chapters, episodes, and seasons, e.g., “For more, read Part 2 of our investigation”; “I loved  Friday Night Lights  — except for Season 2”; “I couldn’t make it past Chapter 1 of  The Goldfinch .”"
714,pawprint,
715,pedophile:,"Do not use the term “pedophile” to describe someone who has abused children. (Pedophilia is a psychiatric disorder in which someone experiences sexual desire for children.) Instead, state clearly if someone has exhibited predatory behavior toward children or refer to legal charges, such as “convicted of child sexual abuse.”"
716,peekaboo,
717,peeping Tom,
718,PEN15,
719,people-first language,"People-first language refers to descriptions that center the individual(s) rather than the condition(s) — for example, using “person with a disability” instead of “disabled person.” Although PFL was created by disability advocates to emphasize the agency of disabled people, it has fallen out of favor in certain communities. That said, we default to using PFL over identity-first language when referring to mental illness or other specific diseases and disorders and identity-first language when discussing disabled people more generally. When a person’s disability is a focal point of an article, always ask what they prefer."
720,Pepe the frog,
721,pepper spray,"(n.);  pepper-spray
(v.)"
722,percentages,"Use numeral + percent sign — unless a percentage starts a sentence, in which case spell out the number and use the word “percent,” e.g., “The survey showed that 88% of people would rather hang out with Lil Bub than Anne Hathaway”; “Eighty-five percent of the staff voted for a pizza party” (exception: OWS terms  the 1 percent
and  the 99 percent
)."

732,photo captions and illustrations,"• Use parentheses to indicate a directional: “Former president Obama (center) meets with Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.”
• If listing several names in a bigger group pictured, begin the caption with  From left:
(rather than  From left to right ).
• Generally, credits should read:  Photographer’s Name / Agency
• Credits for in-house photographers, illustrators, and designers should read:  Name / BuzzFeed News
• Credits for commissioned art/photos and freelance designers and illustrators should read:  Name for BuzzFeed News
• Do not italicize photo captions.
• Photo captions that are full sentences should end in a period: “Joe Biden’s dogs, Major and Champ, frolic on the White House lawn.” Captions that are fragments (e.g., simply names of people in the photo) do not take a period.
• When a thumbnail image does not appear in a story, add its photo credit to the bottom of the post using the “small” HTML tags."

754,Pornhub,

756,possessives,"• Use  ’s
for all singular possessive nouns, e.g., Chris’s, Bezos’s, Spears’s. Exceptions:
• BuzzFeed News’ (e.g., BuzzFeed News’ reporting)
• Corporation or brand names that are pluralized, e.g., General Motors’
• When a proper noun is already plural, the usual rule for possessives applies: “the Smiths’ house,” “the Rolling Stones’ music,” “the United States’ policies.”
• Do NOT use an apostrophe when a word is primarily descriptive rather than possessive, e.g., “homeowners association,” “kids department,” “teachers college,” “writers room.”
• Contrary to AP, words ending with an  s  sound before a word that begins with “s” take an apostrophe + “s”: “for appearance’s sake,” “for conscience’s sake” (but “for goodness’ sake”).
• Use roman type for punctuation and possessives (e.g., apostrophe + s) that follow italicized titles of works or words as words, e.g., “ Emily in Paris ’s first season was panned by critics.”"
757,post-,"Hyphenate unless it has its own entry in  MW , e.g., “postcollege,” “postmortem,” “postdoc,” “postwar.”"

761,preexisting,
762,pregnancy,"• Spell out numbers less than 10, e.g., “eight months pregnant,” “six-week abortion ban,” etc.
• Use  fetus
when writing about pregnancy in general terms, but for personal stories about pregnancy,  unborn baby
is OK.
• When writing about pregnancies in general, use gender-neutral language. Avoid referring to  pregnant women  or framing this as something that exclusively affects women. OK to stet “pregnant women” in specific cases (e.g., a study about pregnant women)."
763,PrEP,(for the HIV prevention regimen)
764,prepandemic,"(not  pre-pandemic ),  postpandemic"
765,pride,"• Capitalize  Pride

instead of  rainbow flag  or  rainbow pride flag ."

767,primetime,"(one word, all forms)"
768,problematic,Avoid; use a more specific description.
769,profanity,"Inoffensive, “casual-use” profanity is OK in cases where it’s warranted by the tone or subject matter of a post, e.g., “They shit-talked their ex,” “They royally fucked up,” etc. should be spelled out in running copy as well as in heds and deks. More sensitive words, like the c-word or n-word, should generally be styled thusly; OK to spell out n-word if it appears in a quote or in song lyrics."
770,pronouns,"• Always defer to the pronouns a person uses for themself. (It’s not rude to ask. In fact, it’s encouraged to ask, “What pronouns do you use?”)
•  They
is acceptable (and preferred!) as a singular stand-in when gender is unknown or irrelevant, e.g., “If someone is knocking at your door and you don’t know who they are…” It should also be used when it is the pronoun someone uses.
• Use  he/him pronouns
and  she/her pronouns
instead of  male pronouns  or  female pronouns .
• Instead of saying  preferred pronoun , describe the pronoun with which someone identifies in neutral terms, e.g., “Sam Smith uses they/them pronouns.”"
771,the Prophet Muhammad,
772,protest:,"•  protester
(not  protestor ), counterprotester
,  counterdemonstration
• Capitalize formal and abbreviated formal names of protests, e.g., the Women’s March, the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom, the March on Washington.
• In general, be as specific as possible when describing protests and groups of protesters. Do not use terms like  alt-right ,  white nationalist ,  leftist , or  liberal  as blanket terms unless you are sure they are accurate."

780,punchline,
781,Pusha-T,(with hyphen)
782,Q&A,"• When formatting Q&As, bold the question BuzzFeed asks (without identification of “BuzzFeed” or editor’s name as interviewer); answers by interviewee are not bolded, but the interviewee’s name is. Use a line space between every question and answer (and answer and answer, if more than one person is being interviewed).
• Unless it is clear from context, interviewees’ full names are spelled out and bolded in their first response. If two or more people are being interviewed, use their initials to identify them in subsequent answers.
• Don’t italicize the intro; add an extra space between the intro and the first question if the Q&A section does not begin in a separate text box.
• Set off indication of laughing and such reactions as follows: [ laughs ]"
783,QAnon,"Use  collective delusion
or  mass delusion
when referring to the conspiratorial movement; avoid  conspiracy theory . For more information, see  “ Here’s Why BuzzFeed News Is Calling QAnon a ‘Collective Delusion’ From Now On .”"
784,quotations,"•  verbs to avoid:
Stick with neutral  said  — synonyms like  contended, emphasized,   claimed , and  explained  are distracting/editorializing and sometimes inaccurate/misleading.
•  tense:
Use past tense for attributions ( they said ) and present when describing actions in a video, affidavit, book, etc. ( she says in the lawsuit ).
•  Google translate:
Avoid this —  and word-for-word translations generally — at all costs. Instead, link to social media posts, statements, etc. and/or reliable translations from other outlets that capture nuance and use English sentence structure and idioms (e.g.,  She had fear  —>  She was afraid ).
•  avoid using brackets and [sic]:
Paraphrase if original is confusing. Do not correct/omit typos made in social media posts or interviews via text or email.
•  transcriptions:
Read all transcriptions — whether your own or quoting from another source — for sense.
•  verbal tics:
Generally OK to skip “stop words”/phrases like  um  and  you know.
•  “that”:
Never use a comma after this when it precedes a quote and use only with fragments.
•  commas:
Use when introducing quoted speech/writing — but not preceding titles etc. in quotations etc. ( Their pink T-shirts said “#FreeBritney ”;  The group chanted, “Free Britney!” )
•  punctuation with long quotations:
For quotations comprising two grafs or more, start each graf with opening quotation marks and do not only use closing quotations until the end of the last graf.
•  location of “said”:
Attribution follows the name ( “Ivermectin is awesome!” Aaron Rodgers said ), but it’s OK to flip when accompanied by an identifier:  “Ivermectin is awesome!” said Aaron Rodgers, the quarterback of the Green Bay Packers ).
•  don’t end a post with attribution:
A kicker like “ How do we sleep while our beds are burning?”  loses its punch and power if it ends with  Peter Garrett asked.  Compare to:  Musician and environmental activist Peter Garrett delivered an urgent call to action on climate change decades ago in an iconic Midnight Oil song, which asked: “How do we sleep while our beds are burning?”"
785,quote-unquote,(in speech)
786,Qur’an,(not  Quran  or  Koran )
787,R. Patz,(abbreviation for Robert Pattinson)
788,race and ethnicity,"• Use good judgment when determining whether it is appropriate to mention a person’s race/ethnicity in a story.
• When describing suspects sought by the police or in missing person cases, race should be mentioned only if there is a detailed description to work with that includes attire and/or other identifying marks. Do not refer to the race of the person when apprehended or found.
• Capitalize the proper names of nationalities, peoples, races, tribes, etc.
• Do not use hyphens to denote dual heritage, ethnicity, or religion. This applies to both nouns and adjectives, e.g., Jewish American, Asian American, Turkish American, American Muslim. For more, see  Henry Fuhrmann’s piece “Drop the Hyphen in Asian American” in Conscious Style Guide . For all of this, we defer to a subject’s self-identity, so writers should ask whenever possible.
• Generally avoid the use of  Black  and  white  as nouns, except when referencing statistical information.
• When describing the ethnicity of people with origins in Caribbean countries, use Haitian, Haitian American, Jamaican American, etc., rather than African American. In stories where race is a factor, when possible, ask people how they choose to self-identify. Do not use  African American  to describe African people who live in the United States unless it is a subject’s expressed preference.
• Avoid clumsy euphemisms like  urban-targeted  or  race-themed  to describe films or television programs with majority-Black casts."
789,rainforest,
790,ratings systems:,"Use numerals for rankings and reviews, e.g., “4 out of 5 stars,” “1-star Michelin restaurant.”"
791,ratioed,(for the past tense of  ratio )

793,rearview,(adj.)
794,reboot,"Use this term when a series or franchise resets with a clean slate in terms of canon and continuity, often with the main characters recast, e.g.,  The Batman  (2022),  Lost in Space  (2018). For nonfiction, telltale signs might be new hosts or a revised concept, e.g.,  Queer Eye  (2018). See also  remake
,  revival
."
795,recipes,"• Order: List ingredients in the order in which they appear in the instructions.
• Spell out measurements in lists of ingredients and instructions, e.g., “teaspoon,” “tablespoon,” “ounce,” “pound.” In videos and other situations where space constraints must be considered, OK to abbreviate measurements (“tsp,” “tbsp,” “oz,” “lb”).
• Use numerals only throughout (in both ingredient lists and instructions): 1 1/2 teaspoons sugar, 4 cloves of garlic, 2 servings, makes 12 servings, etc. Also: 2 to 3 tablespoons (not 2–3 tablespoons).
• Use numerals in subheadings/recipe names like “7-Layer Dip” or “4-Ingredient Cake.”
• Ingredients with nonspecific amounts or measures are initial-capped in lists, e.g., “Freshly ground black pepper.”
• Include ingredients added “to taste” (also: cooking spray) in the list of ingredients.
• Include an “F” for “Fahrenheit” after the º sign, e.g., “Preheat oven to 375ºF” (note: no spaces).
• When republishing recipes from cookbooks or other previously published materials, print as they appeared in their original form.
• Sample recipe copy:  Upside-Down Apricot Cake"

If it seems unclear, ask an editor which type of update is more appropriate.
• Anytime a story has been updated, you should also check the “update checkmark” below the bylines and published timestamp to indicate the date and time at which the update was made.
• To indicate that a post has been updated or is developing in the dek of a story, please do so in plain text. Do not italicize, bold, or place the “Update” or “Developing” in all caps (example  here .) If necessary, add “This post has been updated” in a dek when there’s been a full write-through of the original post with new information.
